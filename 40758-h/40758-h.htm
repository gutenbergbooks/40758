<p>The volume in hand might perhaps better have
been entitled "Library Notes," as the pages are literally
the gathered notes of the author's library-hours.
The reader will kindly peruse these pages remembering
that they assume only to be the gossip, as it were,
of the author with himself,&mdash;notes which have grown
to these proportions by casual accumulation in the
course of other studies, and without consecutive purpose.
That these notes thus made have been put
into printed form, is owing to the publisher's chance
knowledge and hearty approval of them. These few
lines are by way, not of apology,&mdash;no sensible person
ever made an apology, according to Mr. Emerson,&mdash;but
of introduction; so that the reader may not fancy
he is to encounter a labored essay upon the theme
suggested by the title of the volume.</p>

<p>These pages may not be without a certain wholesome
influence, if, fortunately, they shall incite others
to analyze the character of genius as exhibited by the
masters of art and literature. The facts alluded to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
though familiar to many, are not so to all; wherefore
the volume may indirectly promote the knowledge
of both history and biography, at the same time leading
the thoughtful reader to seek further and more
ample information concerning those individuals who
are here so briefly introduced.</p>

<p class="large center p2">CHAPTER I.</p>


<p>The ever-flowing tide of time rapidly obliterates
the footprints of those whom the world has delighted
to honor. While it has caused heroic names, like
their possessors, to lapse into oblivion, it has also
shrouded many a historical page with the softened
veil of distance, like ivy-grown towers, rendering
what was once terrible now only picturesque. In
glancing back through thousands of years, and permitting
the mind to rest on the earliest recorded
epochs, one is apt to forget how much human life
then, in all its fundamental characteristics, was like
our own daily experience. There never was a golden
age; that is yet to come. The most assiduous antiquarian
has only corroborated the fact that human
nature is unchanged. Conventionalities, manners and
customs, the fashions, may change, but human nature
does not. As an example of the mutability of fame,
we have only to ask ourselves what is actually known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to-day of Homer,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Aristophanes, and their renowned
contemporaries, or even of our more familiar Shakespeare?<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Of the existence of the first named we have
evidence in his two great epics, the Iliad and the
Odyssey; but, though deemed the most famous poet
that ever lived, we do not even know his birthplace.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Ten ancient towns contend for Homer dead,<br />
Through which the living Homer begged his bread."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The cautious historian only tells us that he is supposed
to have flourished about nine hundred years
before the time of Christ; while there are also learned
writers who contend that no such person as Homer<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
ever lived, and who attribute the two most famous
poems of antiquity to various minstrels or ballad-mongers,
who celebrated the "tale of Troy divine"
at various periods, and whose songs and legends were
fused into unity at the time of Pisistratus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p><p>Over the personality of Aristophanes,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> the great
comic poet of Greece, who is supposed to have flourished
some five or six hundred years later than
Homer, there rests the same cloud of obscurity, and
he is clearly identified only by eleven authentic comedies
which are still extant, though he is believed to
have written fifty. Of Shakespeare, born some two
thousand years later (1564), how little is actually
known beyond the fact of his birthplace! Even the
authorship of his plays, like that of Homer's poems,
is a subject of dispute. Perhaps, however, this loss
of individuality but adds to the influence of the poet's
divine mission. The really great men of history,
benefactors of their race, are those who still live in
the undying thoughts which they have left behind
them.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In this familiar gossip we propose to glance briefly
at such names as may suggest themselves, without
observing any strict system of classification. The
theme is so fruitful, the pages of history so teem with
portraits which stand forth in groups to attract the
eye, that one hardly knows where to begin, what matter
to exclude, what to adduce; and therefore, closing the
elaborate records of the past, we will trust to momentary
inspiration and the ready promptings of memory.</p>

<p>The first thought which strikes us in this connection
is, that the origin of those whom the world has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>called great&mdash;men who have written their names
indelibly upon the pages of history&mdash;is often of the
humblest character. Such men have most frequently
risen from the ranks. In fact, genius ignores all social
barriers and springs forth wherever heaven has
dropped the seed. The grandest characters known
in art, literature, and the useful inventions have
illustrated the axiom that "brave deeds are the
ancestors of brave men;" and it would almost appear
that an element of hardship is necessary to
the effective development of true genius. Indeed,
when we come to the highest achievements of the
greatest minds, it seems that they were not limited
by race, condition of life, or the circumstances of
their age. "It is," says Emerson, "the nature of
poetry to spring, like the rainbow daughter of Wonder,
from the Invisible, to abolish the past and refuse
all history." But this of course refers only to
poetry in its loftiest and noblest conceptions and
sentiments; and then only in passages of a great
work.</p>

<p>Æsop, the fabulist, who flourished six hundred
years before Christ, and whose fables are as familiar
to us after the lapse of twenty-five hundred years as
household words; Publius Syrus,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the eminent moralist,
who lived in the time of Julius Cæsar, and
whose wise axioms are to be found in every library;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>Terence,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the Carthaginian poet and dramatist;
Epictetus, the stoic philosopher,&mdash;all were slaves
in early life,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but won freedom and lasting fame by
force of their native genius. No man is nobler than
another unless he is born with better abilities, a more
amiable disposition, and a larger heart and brain.
The field is open to all; for it is fixedness of purpose
and perseverance that win the prizes of this
world,&mdash;qualities that can be exercised by the most
humble.</p>

<p>Protagoras, the Greek sophist and orator, was in
his youth a street porter of Athens, carrying loads
upon his back like a beast of burden. He was a
singularly independent genius, and was expelled
from his native city because he openly doubted the
existence of the gods. His countryman, Cleanthes
the stoic, was also "a hewer of stone and drawer of
water," but rose among the Athenians to be esteemed
as a rival of the great philosopher Zeno. He wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>many works in his day,&mdash;about three hundred years
before the Christian Era,&mdash;none of which have
been preserved except a hymn to Jupiter, which is
remarkable for purity of thought and elevation of
sentiment.</p>

<p>We need not confine ourselves, however, to so remote
a period to illustrate that genius is independent
of circumstances. In our random treatment of the
subject there occurs to us the name of Bandoccin, one
of the most learned men of the sixteenth century, who
was the son of an itinerant shoemaker, and who was
himself brought up to the trade. Gelli, the prolific
Italian author, and president of the Florentine Academy,
was a tailor by trade, and of very humble birth.
His moral dialogues entitled, <i>I Capricci del Bottajo</i>
("The Whims of the Cooper"), have been pronounced
by competent critics to be extraordinary for
originality and piquancy, while all his works are remarkable
for purity of diction. Canova, the sculptor
of world-wide fame, was the son of a day-laborer in
the marble quarries. Opie, the distinguished English
painter, earned his bread at the carpenter's trade
until his majority, but before his death became professor
of painting in the Royal Academy. Amyot,
the brilliant scholar, and professor of Greek, Hebrew,
and Latin, who is ranked among those who have contributed
most towards the perfection of the French
language, learned to write upon birch-bark with
charcoal, while he lived on a loaf of bread per day.
This man rose to be grand almoner of France, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
proved that courage, perseverance, and genius need
no ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Akenside, the English didactic poet, wit, essayist,
and physician, author of the "Pleasures of the Imagination,"
was a butcher's boy. His developed genius
caused him to be appointed to the Queen's household.
Sir Humphry Davy was an apothecary's apprentice
in his youth. Matthew Prior, the English poet and
diplomatist, began life as a charity scholar. Rollin,
famous for his "Ancient History," was the son of a
poor Parisian cutler, and began life at an iron-forge.
James Barry, the eminent historical painter, was
in his minority a foremast hand on board an Irish
coasting-vessel. D'Alembert, the remarkable French
mathematician, author, and academician, was at birth
a poor foundling in the streets of Paris, though it
must be added that he was the illegitimate and discarded
son of Madame de Tencin, one of the wickedest,
most profligate, most cynical, and ablest of the
high-placed women of France. D'Alembert scorned
her<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> proffered help when she, learning that he was the
offspring of one of her desultory amours, attempted
to assist him by her money and patronage. He lived
austerely poor, and his love was lavished, not on
his natural, or rather unnatural, mother, but on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>indigent woman who had picked him up in the
street, and who by self-denial had enabled him to
obtain sustenance and education. As soon as he
was old enough to realize his true situation, he
said, "I have no name, but with God's help I will
make one!" The time came when Catherine II. of
Russia offered him one hundred thousand francs per
annum to become the educator of her son, which he
declined.</p>

<p>Béranger, the lyric poet of France, whose effectiveness
and purity of style defy criticism, was at one
time a barefooted orphan on the boulevards of the
great city. His verses, bold, patriotic, and satirical,
were in every mouth among the masses of his countrymen,
contributing more than any other cause to
produce the revolution of 1830.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> He had the noble
independence to refuse all official recognition under
government. Rachel, it will be remembered, was
in her childhood a street-ballad singer. A resident
of the French capital once pointed out to the writer
a spot on the Champs Élysées where at the age of
twelve, so pale as to seem scarcely more than a
shadow, she used to appear daily, accompanied by
her brother. A rude cloth was spread on the ground,
upon which she stood and recited tragic scenes from
Corneille and Racine, or sang patriotic songs for
pennies, accompanied upon the violin by her brother.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p>Her attitudes, gestures, and voice always captivated
a crowd of people. Rachel was a Jewish pedler's
daughter, though she was born in Switzerland; and
in these youthful days she wore a Swiss costume upon
the boulevards.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Boccaccio, the most famous of Italian novelists, was
the illegitimate son of a Florentine tradesman, and
began life as a merchant's clerk. It is well known
that Shakespeare borrowed the plot of "All's Well
that Ends Well" from Boccaccio.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In fact, the "Decamerone"
furnished him with plots for several of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>his plays. Chaucer derived from the same source
his poem of the "Knight's Tale." We never hear
shallow people reflecting upon the Bard of Avon for
taking some of his plots from earlier writers, and
weaving about them the golden threads of his superb
genius, without recalling Dryden's remark relative to
Ben Jonson's adaptations and translations from the
classics, in such plays as "Catiline" and "Sejanus."
"He invades authors," says Dryden, "like a monarch;
and what would be theft in other writers is but
victory in him." Sterne's idea upon the same subject
also suggests itself. "As monarchs have a right," he
says, "to call in the specie of a State and raise its
value by their own impression, so are there certain
prerogative geniuses who are above plagiaries,
who cannot be said to steal, but from their improvement
of a thought, rather to borrow it, and repay
the commonwealth of letters with interest again, and
may more properly be said to adopt than to kidnap a
sentiment, by leaving it heir to their own fame."</p>

<p>Columbus, who gave a new world to the old, was a
weaver's son, and in his youth he earned his bread
as a cabin-boy in a coasting-vessel which sailed from
Genoa. The story of the great Genoese pilot possesses
a more thrilling interest than any narrative
which the imagination of poet or romancer has ever
conceived. His name flashes a bright ray over the
mental darkness of the period in which he lived. In
imagination one sees him wandering for years from
court to court, begging the necessary means where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>with
to prosecute his inspired purpose,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and finally,
after successfully accomplishing his mission, languishing
in chains and in prison.</p>

<p>How naturally Halleck's invocation to Death, in
"Marco Bozarris," occurs to us here, as the hero,
when his object has been attained, joyfully faces the
grim monarch:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Thy grasp is welcome as the hand<br />
Of brother in a foreign land;<br />
Thy summons welcome as the cry<br />
That told the Indian isles were nigh,<br />
To the world-seeking Genoese,<br />
When the land wind from woods of palm<br />
And orange-groves and fields of balm<br />
Blew o'er the Haytian seas."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>De Foe, the author of "Robinson Crusoe," and of
over two hundred other books, was a hosier by trade,
the son of a London butcher named James Foe. The
particle <i>De</i> was added by the son without other
authority than the suggestion of his own fancy.
Cardinal Wolsey and Kirke White were also sons of
butchers.</p>

<p>Claude Lorraine, the glorious colorist, whose very
name has become a synonym in art, was in youth employed
as a pastry-cook. Molière, the great French
dramatist and actor, who presents one of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>remarkable instances of literary success known to history,
was the son of a tapestry-maker, and was himself
at one time apprenticed to a tailor, and afterwards
became a <i>valet-de-chambre</i>. When Molière was valet to
Louis XIII., he had already appeared upon the stage,
and was rather sneered at by the other members of
the king's household. The generous monarch observed
this, and determined to put a stop to it: "I am
told you have short commons here, Molière, and some
of my people decline to serve you," said Louis, as he
rose from his breakfast one day. "Sit down here at
my table. I warrant you are hungry." And the king
cut him a portion of chicken and put it upon his plate
just at the moment when a distinguished member
of the royal household entered. "You see me," said
the king, "giving Molière his breakfast, as some of
my people do not think him good enough company
for themselves." From that hour the royal valet
was treated with due consideration. William Cobbett,
the English author and vigorous political writer,
was a poor farmer's boy and entirely self-educated.
Izaak Walton, the delightful biographist and miscellaneous
author, whose "Complete Angler" would
make any man's name justly famous, was for years a
linen-draper in London. Pope and Southey were the
sons of linen-drapers.</p>

<p>How rapidly instances of the triumphs of genius
over circumstances multiply upon us when the mind
is permitted to roam at will through the long vista of
the past! Cervantes, the Spanish Shakespeare, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
"Don Quixote" is as much a classic<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> as "Hamlet,"
was a common foot-soldier in the army of Castile.
In 1575 he was captured by an Algerine corsair and
carried as a slave to Algiers, where he endured the
most terrible sufferings. He was finally ransomed and
returned to Spain. Alexandre Dumas's grandmother
was an African slave. Hugh Miller, author, editor,
poet, distinguished naturalist, whose clear, choice
Saxon-English caused the Edinburgh "Review" to ask,
"Where could this man have acquired his style?" was
a stone-mason, and his only college was a stone-quarry.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Keats, the sweetest of English poets, whose delicacy
of fancy and beauty of versification are "a joy forever,"
was born in a stable. Oliver Cromwell, one
of the most extraordinary men in English history,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>famous as a citizen, great as a general, and greatest
as a ruler, was the son of a malt-brewer. Howard,
the philanthropist and author, whose name stands a
monument of Christian fame, was at first a grocer's
boy. Rossini, one of the greatest of modern composers,
was the son of an itinerant musician and a
strolling actress. Andrea del Sarto was the son of a
tailor, and took his name from his father's trade. Perino
del Vaga was born in poverty and nearly starved
in his boyhood. Perugino, whose noble painting of the
"Infant Christ and the Virgin" adorns the Albani
Palace at Rome, grew up in want and misery. We
all remember the story of the shepherd-boy Giotto,
who finally came to be so eminent a painter, and
the intimate friend of Dante; like Michael Angelo,
he was an architect and sculptor. Paganini, one
of the greatest of instrumental performers that ever
lived, was born in poverty and was illegitimate. He
gained enormous sums of money by his wonderful
exhibitions and musical compositions, but was spoiled
by adulation, becoming reckless and dissipated. His
performances in the cities of Europe created a <i>furore</i>
before unparalleled in the history of music, and never
since surpassed.</p>

<p>Wilson the unequalled ornithologist, Dr. Livingstone
the heroic missionary and African traveller,
and Tannahill<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> the Scottish poet,&mdash;author of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
familiar and favorite song, "Jessie, the Flower of
Dumblane,"&mdash;earned their living in youth as journeymen
weavers. Joost van den Vondel, the national
poet of Holland, was a hosier's apprentice. Molière,
already referred to, began his career as a journeyman
tailor, but occasionally his maternal grandfather took
him to the play, and thus were sown the seeds which
led to his greatness as a dramatic author and actor.
Samuel Woodworth, author of the "Old Oaken
Bucket," one of the sweetest lyrics in our language,
was a journeyman printer. Richard Cobden,
statesman, economist, and author, was a poor Sussex
farmer's son, whose youthful occupation was that of
tending sheep. John Bright, the intimate friend and
coadjutor of Cobden, one of the greatest, most eloquent,
and most successful of English reformers, was
the son of a cotton-spinner. Lord Clyde, the successful
general who crushed the rebellion in India, and
who was made a peer of England, was the son of a
carpenter. The motto of his life, always inscribed
upon the fly-leaf of his pocket memorandum-book,
was: "By means of patience, common-sense, and time,
impossibilities become possible."</p>

<p>John Bunyan,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the author of "Pilgrim's Progress,"
the solace and delight of millions, and a text-book for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>all future time, was a tinker. His great work is said
to have obtained a larger circulation than any other
English book except the translation of the Bible.
Benjamin Franklin, statesman, philosopher, epigrammatist,
was a tallow-chandler.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Nathaniel Bowditch,
the eminent mathematician, was a cooper's apprentice.
He was twenty-one years of age before he may be said
to have begun his education, but in his prime was
a Fellow of the Royal Society of London, and was
offered the chair of mathematics in Harvard College.
Hiram Powers, the first sculptor from this country to
win European fame, was brought up a ploughboy on a
Vermont farm; his "Greek Slave" gave him high rank
among modern sculptors. Elihu Burritt, the remarkable
linguist, was a Connecticut horse-shoer. Whitefield,
the eloquent English preacher and father of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>sect of Calvinistic Methodists, was in youth the stable-boy
of an English inn. Cardinal Wolsey, chief minister
of Henry VIII., was brought up to follow his
father's humble calling of a butcher. Horne Tooke,
the English wit, priest, lawyer, and genius, was the
son of a poulterer.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Correra, afterwards president of
Guatemala, was born in poverty, and for years was
a drummer-boy in the army, where he was laughed
at for saying that the world should some day hear
from him, being reminded that his present business
was to make a noise in the world. But he meant
what he said, and acted under Lord Clyde's motto.
He rose by degrees to the highest position in the gift
of his countrymen. "To the persevering mortal the
blessed immortals are swift," says Zoroaster.</p>

<p>Ebenezer Elliott, the English "Corn-Law Rhymer,"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
was a blacksmith, but a poet by nature, and his songs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>created a political revolution in his native land,
though unlike Béranger's, in France, it was a peaceful
revolution. He was ever a true champion of the poor
and oppressed. In the latter portion of his life he
was in easy pecuniary circumstances. William Lloyd
Garrison,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> the beloved philanthropist, orator, and
writer, was born in poverty, and was early apprenticed
to a shoemaker, but became a journeyman
printer before his majority. He suffered imprisonment
for his opinions' sake, and may be said to have
been the father of Abolitionism in America, fortunately
living long enough to see the grand effort of
his life crowned with success, in the emancipation of
the blacks and the abolishment of slavery throughout
the length and breadth of his native land. Kepler, the
famous German astronomer, was the son of a poor
innkeeper, and though enjoying royal patronage, often
felt the pressure of poverty. Coleridge said: "Galileo
was a great genius and so was Newton; but it would
take two or three Galileos and Newtons to make one
Kepler." We owe our knowledge of the laws of the
planetary system to him.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Arkwright, inventor of the spinning-jenny,
and founder of the great cotton industries of
England, never saw the inside of a schoolhouse until
after he was twenty years of age, having long served
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>as a barber's assistant. Justice Tenterden, and
Turner, greatest among landscape-painters, were also
brought up to the same trade. James Brindley, the
English engineer and mechanician, and Cook, the
famed navigator, were day-laborers in early life.
Romney, the artist, John Hunter, the physiologist,
Professor Lee, the Orientalist, and John Gibson,
the sculptor, were carpenters by trade. Shakespeare
was a wool-comber in his youth. These low estates,
the workshop and the mine, have often contributed
liberally to recruit the ranks of those whom the world
has recognized as men of genius.</p>

<p>Horace Mann declared that education is our only
political safety. He might have gone further, and
said our only moral safety also. It is not, however,
the school and the college alone that bring about this
grand object, though they are natural adjuncts. Real
education is the apprenticeship of life, and that is
always the best which we realize in our struggle to
obtain a livelihood. Genius, as a rule, owes little to
scholastic training,&mdash;within these pages there will be
found proof sufficient of this. Sir T. F. Buxton says
he owed more to his father's gamekeeper, who could
neither read nor write, than to any other source of
knowledge. He said this man was truly his "guide,
philosopher, and friend," whose memory was stored
with more varied rustic knowledge, good sense, and
mother wit, than his young master ever met with
afterwards. He adds that he was his first instructor,
and that he profited far more by his remarks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and admonitions than by those of his more learned
tutors.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps at first thought it may seem singular that
so many unschooled geniuses should have risen to be
famous in their several departments, but it is because
they were geniuses. They saw and understood nature
and art by intuition, while those of us who can claim
no such distinction have been compelled to acquire
knowledge by plummet and line, so to speak. "The
ambition of a man of parts," says Sydney Smith,
"should be not to know books, but things; not to
show other men that he has read Locke, and Montesquieu,
and Beccaria, and Dumont, but to show that
he knows the subjects upon which they have written."
Let us pursue our examples still further, for they are
both interesting and remarkable when brought thus
together.</p>

<p>Benjamin West<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> was born in Pennsylvania, a poor
farmer's boy; but the genius of art was in him, and
after patient study he became an eminent painter,
finally succeeding Sir Joshua Reynolds as president of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>the Royal Academy in 1792. George III. was his personal
friend and patron. He was so thoroughly appreciated
there that he made England his home, where he
died in 1820. John Britton, author of the "Beauties
of England and Wales," as well as of several valuable
works on architecture, was born in a mud cabin in
Wiltshire, and was for years engaged as a bar-tender.
He was finally turned adrift by his employer with two
guineas in his pocket, but before his death his list of
published books exceeded eighty volumes! Sir Francis
Chantrey, the eminent sculptor, was in his minority
a journeyman carver in wood. Talma, the great
tragic actor of France, and favorite of the first Napoleon,
was a dentist by trade. Gifford, the eminent
English critic and essayist, was "graduated" from a
cobbler's bench. When Cicero was asked concerning
his lineage, he replied, "I commence an ancestry."
Beaumarchais, the successful French dramatist, author
of the "Barber of Seville" and the "Marriage of
Figaro," was a watchmaker by trade, but developed
such versatile genius as finally to excite the jealousy
of the unscrupulous Voltaire.</p>

<p>Thomas Ball, the sculptor, who has done so much
to ornament the parks and squares of Boston, used
as a lad to sweep out the halls of the Boston Museum.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
The author has often been within the walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>of his pleasant studio in the environs of Florence,
adjoining his charming domestic establishment. It is
near to the spot where Powers produced his "Greek
Slave," and overlooks the lovely city of Florence,
divided by the Arno. Andrew Jackson, who became
President of the United States, was the son of a poor
Irish emigrant, and so was John C. Calhoun, the
great Southern statesman and Vice-President. Abraham
Lincoln and the late President Garfield were
both sons of toil, the former being commonly designated
as "the rail-splitter," the latter as "the canal-boy."
Andrew Johnson was a journeyman tailor.
Henry Wilson was a cobbler at the bench until he
was nearly twenty-one. So also was Andersen,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> the
Danish novelist. Jasmin, who has been called the
Burns of France, was the son of a street beggar.
Allan Cunningham, poet, novelist, and miscellaneous
writer, began life as a stone-mason; he became the
father of four sons, all of whom won distinction
in literature. Among the father's novels was that
of "Paul Jones," which was remarkably successful.
Dr. Isaac Miller, Dean of Carlisle, began life as
a weaver, and Dr. Prideaux, Bishop of Worcester,
earned his living in youth as a kitchen-boy at Oxford.
Watt, the great Scotch inventor, whose steam-engine
has revolutionized modern industry, and Whitney,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>inventor of the cotton-gin, were street gamins in
childhood. Both these inventors were thought by
their associates to be "beside themselves" as they
grew towards maturity. "No man is quite sane,"
says Emerson; "each has a vein of folly in his composition,
a slight determination of blood to the head,
to make sure of holding him hard to some one point
which nature has taken to heart."</p>

<p>The world's great men, according to the acceptation
of the term, have not always been great scholars.
General Nathaniel Greene, the successful Revolutionary
commander, second only in military skill to
Washington, was brought up at a blacksmith's forge.
Horace Greeley, orator and journalist, was the son of
a poor New Hampshire farmer and earned his living
for years by setting type. William Sturgeon the able
and famous electrician, Samuel Drew the English
essayist, and Bloomfield the poet, all rose from the
cobbler's bench; and so did Thomas Edwards, the profound
naturalist. Robert Dodsley, the poet, dramatist,
and friend of Pope began life as a London
footman in livery. His tragedy of "Cleone" was so
successful and well constructed, that Dr. Johnson
said, "If Otway had written it, no other of his pieces
would have been remembered," which was certainly
extravagant praise.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Douglas Jerrold was born in
a garret at Sheerness. Hobson, one of England's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>admirals, was a tailor's apprentice in early life. Huntington,
the remarkable preacher and revivalist, was
originally a coal-heaver, and Bewick, the father of
wood-engraving, was a laborer in a coal mine for
many years.</p>

<p>John Gay, the English poet, was not "born with a
silver spoon in his mouth," but in youth he came up to
London, where he served as a clerk to a silk-mercer.
"How long he continued behind the counter," says
Dr. Johnson, "or with what degree of softness and
dexterity he received and accommodated the ladies,
as he probably took no delight in telling it, is not
known." He wrote comedies, fables, farces, and ballads,
and wrote well, and was vastly popular. Gay
was a great gourmand, very lazy, and fond of society.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
The silk-mercer's clerk attained the much-coveted
honor of resting at last in Westminster Abbey.
Boffin, the great navigator, served at first before
the mast as a common sailor. Robert Dick, the
geologist and botanist, followed his trade as a baker
through his whole life.</p>

<p>Would it not seem, in the light of these many instances,
that practical labor forms the best training
even for genius?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>Linnæus (Karl von Linné), the great Swedish botanist,
the most influential naturalist of the eighteenth
century, was a shoemaker's apprentice. His works
upon his favorite study are authority with students of
science all over the world. He became physician to
the king and made his home at Stockholm, but
roamed over all Scandinavia in pursuing his special
science of botany and also that of zoölogy. He will
always be remembered as having been the first to
perfect a systematic and scientific classification of
plants and animals. He lies buried in the Upsala
Cathedral.</p>

<p>Thorwaldsen, the great Danish sculptor, was the
son of an humble Icelandic fisherman, but by reason
of native genius he rose to bear the name of the
greatest of modern sculptors. He left in the Copenhagen
museum alone six hundred grand examples of
the art he adorned. Many of our readers will remember
having seen near Lucerne, Switzerland, one of his
most remarkable pieces of sculpture, representing a
wounded and dying lion of colossal size, designed to
commemorate the heroic fidelity of the Swiss guards
who fell Aug. 10, 1792. Thorwaldsen was passionately
fond of children, so that the moment he entered
a house he gathered all the juveniles about him; and
in most of his marble groups he introduces children.
He never married, but made his beautiful mistress,
the Roman Fortunata, celebrated by repeating her
face in many of his ideal groups. Thorwaldsen gave
an impulse to art in his native country which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
no like example in history; indeed, art is to-day
the religion of Copenhagen, and Thorwaldsen is its
prophet.</p>

<p>George Stephenson, the English engineer and inventor,
was in his youth a stoker in a colliery, learning
to read and write at a laborers' evening school.
John Jacob Astor began life as a pedler in the
streets of New York, where his descendants own a
hundred million dollars worth of real estate.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The
elder Vanderbilt, famous not alone for his millions
but also for his vast enterprise in the development of
commerce and railroads, served as a cabin-boy on a
North River sloop during several years of his youth.
George Peabody, the great American philanthropist
and millionnaire, was born in poverty. Fisher Ames,
the eminent statesman and orator, eked out a precarious
living for years as a country pedagogue. Greatness
lies not alone in the possession of genius, but in
the right and effective use of it.</p>

<p>We have given examples sufficient to illustrate this
branch of our subject, though they might be almost
indefinitely extended. It was Daniel Webster<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>said that "a man not ashamed of himself need not be
ashamed of his early condition in life." Titles are
vendible, but genius is the gift of Heaven.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm is the heritage of youth; it plans with
audacity and executes with vigor: "It is the leaping
lightning," according to Emerson, "not to be
measured by the horse-power of the understanding."
In the accomplishment of great deeds it is undoubtedly
the keenest spur, and consequently those who
have become eminent in the history of the world have
mostly achieved their greatness before gray hairs have
woven themselves about their brows. Unless the tree
has borne ample blossoms in the spring, we shall
look in vain for a generous crop in the fall. Notwithstanding
the abundance of axioms as to youth and
rashness dwelling together, we have ample evidence
that it is the period of deeds, when the senses are unworn
and the whole man is in the vigor of strength
and earnestness. Goethe tells us that the destiny
of any nation depends upon the opinions of its young
men. Let us recall a few examples, in corroboration
of this view, among those who have made their mark
upon the times in which they lived.</p>

<p>Alexander the Great reigned over the Macedonians
at sixteen; Scipio was but twenty-nine at the zenith
of his military glory; Charles XII.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> was only nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>teen
when, as commander-in-chief, he won the famous
battle of Narva; Condé was twenty-two when he
gained the battle of Rocroi; Scipio the Younger conquered
Carthage at thirty-six, and Cortes subdued
Mexico at the same age. At thirty Charlemagne was
master of France and Germany; at thirty-two Clive
had established the British power in India. Hannibal
won his greatest victories before he was thirty, and
Napoleon was but twenty-seven when he outgeneralled
the veteran marshals of Austria on the plains of Italy.
George Washington won his first battle as a colonel
at twenty-two; Lafayette was a major-general in our
army at the age of twenty. Nor are we to look only
for youthful greatness among those who have won laurels
in war. William Pitt was prime minister of England
at twenty-four; Calhoun had achieved national
greatness before he was thirty; while the names of
John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and the elder Pitt in
England also suggest themselves in this connection.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p><p>Handel composed sonatas at ten years of age; Mozart
was equally precocious, and died at thirty-six, at
which age Shakespeare had written "Hamlet." Bellini,
the composer, had produced "II Pirata," "La Sonnambula,"
and "La Norma," before his thirtieth year;
"I Puritani" was finished at thirty, and he died two
years later. Charles Matthews the elder began to
write for the press at fourteen, and Moore wrote
verses for print at the same age; undoubtedly both
were open to cool and judicious criticism.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Henry
Kirke White published a volume of poems at seventeen.
Bryant, the first American poet of celebrity,
began to write verses at the age of ten, and his most
celebrated poem, "Thanatopsis," was written before
he was twenty. Fitz-Greene Halleck, author of "Marco
Bozzaris," wrote verses for the magazines at fourteen.
Congreve was at the height of his literary
fame at four-and-twenty,&mdash;he to whom Dryden said
Shakespeare had bequeathed his poetical crown, and
to whom Pope dedicated his version of the Iliad.
Watt invented the steam-engine before he was thirty.
The reproof administered by his grandmother for his
idleness in taking off and replacing the cover of the
teakettle, and "playing with the steam to no purpose,"
will occur to the reader. Joan of Arc<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> was
but eighteen when she raised the siege of Orléans
and conquered city after city, until Charles VII. was
crowned king at Rheims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p><p>Guizot, the distinguished French statesman and
historian, seems to have been "a child who had
no childhood." At eleven years of age he was
able to read in their respective languages Thucydides,
Demosthenes, Dante, Schiller, Gibbon, and
Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Robert Hall, the eloquent English clergyman, was a
remarkable instance of early mental development.
It is said that before he was ten years of age he
perused with interest and understanding Edwards's
treatises on the "Affections" and on the "Will."
His sermons, essays, and writings generally were
eagerly read and admired by the public; but excessive
application at last brought on insanity. It
was gracefully said of him that his imperial fancy
laid all nature under tribute. Even in madness he
did not lose his power of retort. A hypocritical
condoler visited him in the mad-house, and asked in
a servile tone: "Pray, what brought you here, Mr.
Hall?" Hall touched his brow significantly with his
finger, and replied, "What'll never bring you, sir,&mdash;too
much brains!"<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Macaulay had already won an exalted reputation
for prose and poetry before he was twenty-three, and
N. P. Willis, before he left college, had achieved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>enduring fame by his sacred poems,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> which, in fact,
he never afterwards excelled in a long and successful
literary career. Schiller wrote and published in
his fourteenth year a poem on Moses. Klopstock
began his "Messiah" at seventeen, and Tasso had
produced his "Rinaldo," and completed the first three
cantos of "Jerusalem Delivered," before he was nineteen.
Milton was an unremitting student at ten.
Southey began to write verses before he was eleven,
Chaucer and Cowley at twelve, and Leigh Hunt at
about the same age. Pope,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> like so many others,
began to write poetry as a child, thus proving that
"poets are born and not made." Chatterton, the remarkable
literary prodigy, died at eighteen, but not
until he had established a lasting reputation. Bulwer-Lytton
was a successful author at about the same age,
and so were Keats and Bayard Taylor. Dickens
produced the "Pickwick Papers" before he was
twenty-five, and it may safely be said that in wit,
humor, and originality he never surpassed that delicious
book. These seem interesting facts to remember,
though they do not establish any actual criterion,
since the thoughtful student of the past can adduce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>many notable examples of mature development in
art and literature.</p>

<p>Among these is that of Edmund Burke, on the whole
the greatest of English philosophical statesmen. He
is the most remarkable instance of a number of men of
genius who seem to have grown younger as they grew
older,&mdash;that is, mentally and morally. Macaulay has
noticed that Bacon's writings towards the close of his
career exceeded those of his youth and manhood "in
eloquence, in sweetness and variety of expression, and
in richness of illustration."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> He adds: "In this
respect the history of his mind bears some resemblance
to the history of the mind of Burke. The
treatises on the 'Sublime and Beautiful,'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> though written
on a subject which the coldest metaphysician
could hardly treat without being occasionally betrayed
into florid writing, is the most unadorned of Burke's
works. It appeared when he was twenty-five or
twenty-six. When, at forty, he wrote the 'Thoughts
on the Causes of the Present Discontents,' his reason
and judgment had reached their full maturity, but
his eloquence was in its splendid dawn. At fifty his
rhetoric was as rich as good taste would admit; and
when he died, at almost seventy, it had become ungracefully
gorgeous. In his youth he wrote on the
emotions produced by mountains and cascades, by the
masterpieces of painting and sculpture, by the faces
and necks of beautiful women, in the style of a
Parliamentary report. In his old age he discussed
treaties and tariffs in the most fervid and brilliant
language of romance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p><p>Socrates learned to play on musical instruments in
his old age. Cato at eighty first studied the Greek
language, and Plutarch did not apply himself to learn
the Latin language until about the same age. Theophrastus<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
began his "Character of Man" on his
ninetieth birthday. Peter Rusard, one of the fathers
of French poetry, did not develop his poetic faculty
until nearly fifty. Arnauld, the learned French
theologian and philosopher, translated Josephus in
his eightieth year. Lope de Vega, one of the most
learned men of the sixteenth century, wrote his best
at seventy years of age. Dr. Johnson applied himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>to learn the Dutch language at seventy. At seventy-three,
when quite feeble, he composed a Latin prayer
to test to his own satisfaction the loss or retention of
his mental faculties. Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales"
were the work of the author's last years. Franklin's
philosophical pursuits were but fairly begun at fifty.
La Mothe le Vayer's best treatises were written after
he was eighty years of age, and Izaak Walton's
when he was nearly ninety. Thomas Hobbes, the
remarkable English philosopher and author, published
his version of the Odyssey in his eighty-seventh year,
and his Iliad in his eighty-eighth. Winckelmann,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
author of the "History of Ancient Art," lived in
ignorance and obscurity until the prime of his life,
when he became famous. Landor was busy with
authorship until after he was eighty. The Earl of
Chatham made his most remarkable oratorical effort
at seventy, and our own American orator and statesman,
Robert C. Winthrop, at a still later period of his
life. Fontenelle continued his literary pursuits until
he was ninety-nine, "blossoming in the winter of his
days," as Lord Orrery wrote of him. Ménage, the
celebrated French critic and scholar, wrote sonnets
and epigrams at ninety. Julius Scaliger, the renowned
Italian scholar and poet, dictated to his son,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
at the age of seventy, two hundred verses of his own
composition from memory. Mr. Gladstone and John
Bright, the English statesmen, are more recent examples
of oratorical, mental, and physical powers in
advanced years. George Bancroft the American historian,
in his eighty-sixth year is still engaged in authorship,
and Whittier and Holmes are writing with
unabated vigor at nearly eighty years of age. Miss
Elizabeth Peabody at eighty-four is still a vigorous
writer and active philanthropist, and the same may
be said of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe at the age of sixty-six.
Mrs. Howe, indeed, is one of the foremost of
American women, whether we regard the ripeness of
her scholarship, the breadth of her understanding, the
richness of her imagination, or the quiet intrepidity
with which she champions great reforms.</p>

<p class="large center p4">CHAPTER II.</p>


<p>Who does not enjoy recalling these silent friends,
favorite authors grown dear to us by age and long
association? Some one has said that authors, like
coins, grow dearer as they grow old. Indeed, Samuel
Rogers, the banker and poet, declared that when
friends at his famous "breakfasts" were praising a
new book, he forthwith began to re-read an old one.
All these writers were double-sided, so to speak;
they had their book natures and their human natures,
and it is when we prefer to contemplate them
in the latter aspect that we like them best. Carlyle
calls them "the vanguard in the march of
mind, the intellectual backwoodsmen reclaiming from
the idle wilderness new territory for the thought
and activity of their happier brethren." It is true
that we can form but a partial judgment of authors
by their books, their motives being not always as
pure as we are inclined to believe.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> A traitor like
Bolingbroke is quite capable of writing a captivating
book on patriotism; and it has been said if Satan were
to write one, it would be upon the advantages of virtue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>It is certain he has ever shown such a hearty appreciation
of virtue that he holds in highest estimation
his success in corrupting it. Examples flash across
the memory. There was Sir Thomas More advocating
toleration, while he was himself a fierce persecutor;
Sallust declaring against the licentiousness of
his age, yet addicted to habitual debaucheries; Byron
assuming a misanthropy which he never felt; and
Cowley boasting of his mistresses, though he had not
the courage even to address one. Smollett's descriptions
and scenes were often indelicate, though he was
himself in that respect a faultless man. "As a rule,
the author who is not in genius far above his productions
must be a second-rate one at best," says Bulwer-Lytton.
Sometimes we detect striking likenesses
between the author and his works. Goldsmith, for instance,
was the same hero to low-bred women, and the
same coward to ladies, that he depicts in his charming
comedy. It is difficult, however, in the light of
Handel's inspired music, to realize what an animal
nature possessed him in his every-day mood,&mdash;what
a glutton he was at table; or to reconcile the sublime
strains of Mozart with his trivial personality.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Still,
Buffon persistently declares, "Le style c'est l'homme."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>
<p>Addison, recognized as the purest and most perspicuous
writer of the English language, though exercising
such mastership of the pen, had no oral
ability, and rarely attempted to talk in social circles.
He said of himself that though he had a hundred
pounds in the bank, he had no small coin in his
pocket.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Johnson and Coleridge were famous for their
colloquial facility, but both of these were rather lecturers
than talkers, however delightful in this respect
the latter may have been. Johnson during his life
was undoubtedly more of a power as a talker than as
a writer. It has been said that Scott talked more
poetry and Edmund Burke more eloquence than they
ever wrote. Emerson thought that "better things are
said, more incisive, more wit and insight are dropped
in talk and forgotten, than gets into books." E. H.
Chapin and H. W. Beecher have talked sounder and
more brilliant theology than they ever preached from
the pulpit. Spontaneous thoughts come from our
inner consciousness; sermons and essays, from the
cooler action of the brain. Coleridge, on first meeting
Byron, entertained the poet with one of his monologues,
wherein he ascended into the seventh heaven upon
wings of theology and metaphysics. Leigh Hunt described
the scene to Charles Lamb, and expressed his
wonder that Coleridge should have chosen so unsympathetic
an auditor. "Oh, it was only his fun," explained
Lamb; "there's an immense deal of quiet
humor about Coleridge!" Wordsworth speaks of him
as the "rapt one, with the godlike forehead," the
"heaven-eyed creature." Hazlitt says that "no idea
ever entered the mind of man, but at some period or
other it had passed over his head with rustling pinions."
Talfourd writes of seeing "the palm-trees
wave, and the pyramids tower, in the long perspective
of his style." When Coleridge once asked Lamb,
"Charles, did you ever hear me preach?" he received
the quiet reply, "I never heard you do anything else."
Rogers tells us: "Coleridge was a marvellous talker.
One morning, when Hookham Frere also breakfasted
with me, Coleridge talked for three hours without
intermission about poetry, and so admirably that I
wish every word he uttered had been written down."
Madame de Staël said of him that he was great in
monologue, but that he had no idea of dialogue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>Macaulay was also remarkable for his conversational
powers, which were greatly aided by an excellent
memory. He has been accused of talking too
much; and Sydney Smith once said of him: "He is
certainly more agreeable since his return from India.
His enemies might perhaps have said before&mdash;though
I never did so&mdash;that he talked rather too much; but
now he has occasional flashes of silence that make
his conversation perfectly delightful!" In a party in
which eminent men are present, the rule is said to
be that, for good conversation, the number of talkers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
should never be fewer than the Graces or more than
the Muses. Goldsmith, who wrote so charmingly and
exhibited such a remarkable versatility with the pen,
could make no figure in conversation. Fox, Bentley,
Burke, Curran, and Swift were all brilliant talkers;
Tasso, Dante, Gray, and Dryden<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> were all taciturn.
Of Ben Jonson it is said that he was mostly without
speech, sitting by the hour quite silent in society, sucking
in the wine and humor of his companions.</p>

<p>Sheridan had the reputation of being a brilliant
conversationalist; but we all know that many of his
"impromptus" were laboriously prepared beforehand,
and that he was wont to lie in wait silently for half
an evening watching his opportunity to discharge the
arrows of his polished wit. One would be glad to
learn how it was with Shakespeare in society. He could
hold his own in a controversy, however, as Thomas
Fuller, in his "Worthies of England," says, "Many
were the wet-combats between him and Ben Jonson:<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
which two I behold like a Spanish great galleon
and an English man-of-war; master Jonson, like the
former, was built far higher in learning; solid, but
slow, in his performances. Shakespeare, like the English
man-of-war, lesser in bulk but lighter in sailing,
could turn with all tides, tack about, and take advantage
of all winds by the quickness of his wit and invention."
Shakespeare himself has said, "Silence is
only commendable in a neat's tongue dried and a
maid not vendible;" but the ancient stoics thought
that by silence they heard other men's imperfections
and concealed their own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p><p>The diplomatist Metternich said he had never known
more than ten or twelve persons with whom it was
pleasant to converse. Margaret Fuller said Carlyle's
talk was an amazement to her, though she was familiar
with his writings. His conversation, she declared,
was a splendor scarcely to be faced with steady
eye. He did not converse&mdash;only harangued. She
thought him "arrogant and overbearing, but it was not
the arrogance of littleness, nor self-love, but rather
the arrogance of some old Scandinavian conqueror;
it was his nature, the untamable impulse that had
given him power to crush the dragons. She was not led
to love or revere him, but liked him heartily,&mdash;liked
to see him the powerful smith, the Siegfried, melting
all the old iron in his furnace till it glows to a sunset
red and burns you, if you senselessly go too near."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p>When Dr. Johnson was asked why he was not invited
out to dine as Garrick<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> was, he answered, as if
it was a great triumph to him, "Because great
lords and ladies don't like to have their mouths
stopped!" He indulged a furious hatred to Americans,
and whenever there was an opportunity sneered at
them even more bitterly than he did at Scotchmen. It
will be remembered that he thought something could be
made out of a Scotchman "if you caught him young;"
but he would not admit even this saving clause as
regarded Americans. He said, "I am willing to love
all, all mankind, except an American." He called
them "robbers and pirates;" adding, "I'd burn and
destroy them!"</p>

<p>These words were addressed to Miss Anna Seward,
of Lichfield. It was in the grammar school of this
ancient cathedral town that Addison, Dr. Johnson,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>788788and Garrick received their early education, and Johnson
was a native of the place. Miss Seward's father
was the canon resident of Lichfield Cathedral. In
his family there was a beautiful young lady named
Honora Sneyd, a companion to his daughter. John
André, a cultured London youth, fell in love with
Honora, and was tacitly accepted. The young man
was somewhat suddenly called back to the metropolis
on business, and a separation thus ensued which
seemed to wean the lady's affections from him, so that
she soon after married a Mr. Edgeworth and in the
course of time became the mother of Maria Edgeworth,
the well-known novel-writer.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> John André remained
faithful to his first love, and came to America carrying
in his bosom a miniature of Honora suspended from
his neck. His sad fate during our Revolutionary War
is well known to all. He was the Major André whom
Washington reluctantly executed as a spy, and whose
memorial is now conspicuous in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Peter Corneille, the great French dramatic poet,
had nothing in his exterior that indicated his genius.
As to his conversational powers, they were simply insipid,
and never failed to weary all listeners. Nature
had endowed him with brilliant gifts, but forgot to
grant him the ordinary accomplishments. He did
not even speak correct French, which he never failed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>to write with perfection. When his friends represented
to him how much more he might please by
not disdaining to correct these trivial errors, he would
smile and say, "I am none the less Peter Corneille!"
We learn from Rogers that in the early
days of his popularity Byron was quite diffident in
society, or at least never ventured to take part in
the conversation. If any one happened to let fall an
observation which offended him, he never attempted
to reply, but treasured it up for days, and would
then come out with some cutting remarks, giving
them as his deliberate opinion, the result of his experience
of the individual's character. Southey<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> was
stiff, reserved, sedate, and so wrapped up in a garb of
asceticism that Charles Lamb once stutteringly told
him he was "m-made for a m-m-monk, but somehow
the co-co-cowl didn't fit."</p>

<p>Racine made this confidential confession to his
son: "Do not think that I am sought after by the
great on account of my dramas; Corneille composed
nobler verses than mine, but no one notices him, and
he only pleases by the mouth of the actors. I never
allude to my works when with men of the world, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>I amuse them about matters they like to hear. My
talent with them consists not in making them feel
that I have any, but in showing them that they have."
The well-remembered saying about Goldsmith's lack
of conversational power is excellent because it was
so true; namely, that "he wrote like an angel and
talked like poor Poll."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Fisher Ames and Rufus
Choate were distinguished for their conversational
powers. Stuart, the American painter, was remarkable
in this respect; and so were Washington Allston,
Edgar A. Poe, Margaret Fuller, and the late Caleb
Cushing. The lady just named was considered to be
the best talker of her sex since Madame de Staël.
Indeed, those who knew her well said she talked even
better than she wrote, which was saying much.</p>

<p>Charles Sumner used to relate a talk in a company
where Daniel Webster was present. The
question under discussion was what were the best
means of culture. Webster was silent until all
had spoken. He then said: "Gentlemen, you have
overlooked one of the means of culture which I
consider of the first importance, and from which
I have gained the most; that is, good conversation."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p><p>Whipple has said in one of his essays that "real,
earnest conversation is a kind of intellectual cannibalism,
where strong minds feed on each other and
mightily enjoy the repast."</p>

<p>Charles Lamb's most sportive essays, which read as
though they came almost spontaneously from his pen,
are known to have been the result of intense brain
labor. He would spend a whole week in elaborating
a single humorous letter to a friend. Lamb was so
sensitive concerning proof-reading as to be the dread
of the printers. It is said of the poet-laureate of
England that he has been known to re-write a
poem twenty times and more before he was satisfied
to give it to the printer. Dickens, when writing
a book, was accustomed to shut himself up for
days together, and to work with fearful energy until
the task was completed; after which he would come
forth presenting the appearance of a person recovering
from a fit of illness.  The free-and-easy spirit
which characterizes his pages affords no evidence
of the travail through which their author passed in
giving them birth. Bulwer-Lytton took matters much
more philosophically.  He always worked at pen-craft
leisurely, never more than three or four hours a
day; and yet by carefully observing a system the
aggregate of his productions was very large. Balzac,
after thinking over a subject, would retire to his study
and write it out half a dozen times before he gave
the manuscript to the printer, whom he afterwards
tormented to the very verge of exasperation by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
proof alterations. To come nearer to our own time,
we may remark that Longfellow, whose versification
seems always to have flowed with such ease and
fluency from his pen, was a slow and painstaking
producer, sometimes altering and amending until the
original draft of an essay or poem was quite improved
out of sight.</p>

<p>Dr. Channing nearly drove his printers crazy; after
his manuscript&mdash;almost illegible by corrections and
interlineations&mdash;had been returned to them with
alterations, omissions, and additions on the first
proof-sheets, he would ponder over, alter, and amend
three or four successive proofs before he finally
allowed the result to meet the public eye,&mdash;a new
edition involving another series of alterations. The
lyric which cost Tennyson the most trouble was
"Come into the Garden, Maud." It is said to have
been held back from the public after it had been a
year in his hands, going through repeated processes
of alteration. What time indorses, requires time to
create and finish. To this determination of Tennyson
to condense all his thoughts into the smallest space,
and never to expand when by patient labor he can
contract, we owe the few lines in which he states
in the "Princess" the whole nebular theory of the
universe as expounded by Kant and Laplace; and
how much reflection must have been required to condense
the description of the fundamental defect of
English law, on which volumes have been written, as
he has done in "Aylmer's Field:"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The lawless science of our law,<br />
That codeless myriad of precedent,<br />
That wilderness of single instances."<br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When we observe good workmanship, whether it be
by a stone-mason, a cabinet-maker, or a writer, we
may be sure that it has cost much patient labor. His
biographer tells us that Moore thought ten or fifteen
lines in twenty-four hours a good day's accomplishment
in poetry; and at this rate he wrote "Lalla
Rookh."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Wordsworth wrote his verses, laid them
aside for weeks, then, taking them up, frequently rewrote
them a score of times before he called them
finished. Buffon's "Studies of Nature" cost him
fifty years of writing and re-writing before the work
was published. John Foster, the profound and eloquent
English essayist, often spent hours upon a
single sentence. Ten years elapsed between the first
sketch of Goldsmith's "Traveller" and its final completion.
Rochefoucauld<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> spent fifteen years over his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>little book of Maxims, altering some of them thirty
times. Rogers admitted that he had more than once
spent ten days upon a single verse before he turned
it to suit him. Vaugelas, the great French scholar,
devoted twenty years to his admirable translation of
"Quintus Curtius."</p>

<p>Some authors have produced with such rapidity
as to approach improvisation. Perhaps the most remarkable
instance of this was in the case of Lope de
Vega, who composed and wrote a versified drama in a
single day, and is known to have done so for seven
consecutive days. Contemporary with Shakespeare
and Cervantes, De Vega has left behind him two
thousand original dramas sparkling with vivacity of
dialogue and richness of invention. Soldier, duellist,
poet, sailor, and priest, his long life was one of intense
activity and adventure.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The name of Hardy,
the French dramatic author and actor, occurs to us
in this connection; though an inferior genius to De
Vega, he wrote over six hundred original dramas.
He was considered the first dramatic writer of the
days of Henry IV. and Louis XIII., before whom
Hardy often appeared upon the stage personating the
heroes of his own dramas.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p>Prynne, the English antiquary, politician, and
pamphlet-writer, sat down early in the morning to
his composition. Every two hours his man brought
him a roll and a pot of ale as refreshment; and
so he continued until night, when he partook of a
hearty dinner. One of his pamphlets was entitled
"A Scourge for Stage-Players," which was considered
so scurrilous that the Star-Chamber sentenced him
to pay a heavy fine, to be exposed in the pillory, to
lose his ears, and to be imprisoned for life. He was
finally released from prison. While he was confined
in the pillory, a pyramid of his offending pamphlets
was made close at hand, to windward of his position,
and set on fire, so that the author was very nearly
choked to death by the smoke. He was almost as
incessant and inveterate a writer as Petrarch, and
considered being debarred from pen and ink an act
more barbarous than the loss of his ears. However,
he partially obviated his want of the usual facilities
by writing a whole volume on his prison walls while
confined in the Tower of London.</p>

<p>Byron wrote the "Corsair" in ten days, which was
an average of nearly two hundred lines a day,&mdash;a
fact which he acknowledged to Moore with a degree
of shame. He said he would not confess it to everybody,
considering it to be a humiliating fact, proving
his own want of judgment in publishing, and the public
in reading, "things which cannot have stamina
for permanent attention." The surpassing beauty of
the "Corsair," however, excuses all the author said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
or did in connection with it. It may nevertheless
be affirmed that, as a rule, no great work has ever
been performed with ease, or ever will be accomplished
without encountering the throes of time and
labor. Dante, we remember, saw himself "growing
lean" over his "Divine Comedy." Mary Russell
Mitford, the charming English authoress, dramatist,
poet, and novelist, who so excelled in her sketches
of country life, says of herself: "I write with extreme
slowness, labor, and difficulty; and, whatever
you may think, there is a great difference of facility
in different minds. I am the slowest writer, I suppose,
in England, and touch and retouch incessantly."
Her life was one of constant labor and self-abnegation
in behalf of a worthless, selfish, and imperious
father. He was a robust, showy, wasteful profligate,
and a gambler. A doctor by profession, he
was a spendthrift and sensualist by occupation. He
contracted a venal marriage with an heiress much
older than himself, and after squandering her entire
fortune he fell back upon his daughter as the
bread-winner for the whole family. By a remarkable
chance she became the possessor of a great
lottery prize, from which she realized twenty thousand
pounds, every penny of which her beastly father
drank and gambled away. Still, the devotion and
industry of the daughter never waned for a moment.
Her patient struggles have placed her name on the
roll of fame, while her father's has sunk into deserved
oblivion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>De Tocqueville wrote to his publishers: "You must
think me very slow. You would forgive me if you
knew how hard it is for me to satisfy myself, and how
impossible it is for me to finish things incompletely."
Horace suggested that authors should keep their
literary productions from the public eye for at least
nine years, which certainly ought to produce "the
well-ripened fruit of sage delay." After a labor of
eleven years Virgil pronounced his Æneid imperfect.
This recalls the Italian saying, "One need not be a
stag, neither ought one to be a tortoise." Tasso's
manuscript, which is still extant, is almost illegible
because of the number of alterations which he made
after having written it. Montaigne, "the Horace of
Essayists," could not be induced, so lazy and self-indulgent
was he, to even look at the proof-sheets of
his writings. "I add, but I correct not," he said.</p>

<p>The writer of these pages has seen the original
draft of Longfellow's "Excelsior," so interlined and
amended to suit the author's taste as to make the
manuscript rather difficult to decipher. The poet
wrote a back-hand, as it is called; that is, the letters
sloped in the opposite direction from the usual custom,
and as a rule his writing was remarkably legible.
Coleridge was very methodical as to the time and
place of his composition. He told Hazlitt that he
liked to compose walking over uneven ground, or
making his way through straggling branches of undergrowth
in the woods; which was a very affected and
erratic notion, and might better have been "whipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
out of him."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Wordsworth, on the contrary, found
his favorite place for composing his verses in walking
back and forth upon the smooth paths of his
garden, among flowers and creeping vines. Hazlitt,
in a critical analysis of the two poets, traces a likeness
to the style of each in his choice of exercise
while maturing his thoughts,&mdash;which, it would seem
to us, is a subtile deduction altogether too fine to
signify anything.</p>

<p>Charles Dibdin, the famous London song-writer
and musician, whose sea-songs as published number
over a thousand, caught his ideas "on the fly." As
an example, he was at a loss for something new to
sing on a certain occasion. A friend was with him
in his lodgings and suggested several themes. Suddenly
the jar of a ladder against the street lamp-post
under his window was heard. It was a hint to his
fertile imagination, and Dibdin exclaimed, "The
Lamplighter! That's it; first-rate idea!" and stepping
to the piano he finished both song and words in
an hour, and sang them in public with great éclat
that very night, under the title of "Jolly Dick, the
Lamplighter." Like nearly all such mercurial geniuses,
Dibdin was generous, careless, and improvident
in his habits, dying at last poor and neglected.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>
<p>Dr. Johnson was so extremely short-sighted that
writing, re-writing, and correcting upon paper were
very inconvenient for him; he was therefore accustomed
to revolve a subject very carefully in his mind,
forming sentences and periods with minute care; and
by means of his remarkable memory he retained them
with great precision for use and final transmission to
paper. When he began, therefore, with pen in hand,
his production of copy was very rapid, and it required
scarcely any corrections. Boswell says that
posterity will be astonished when they are told that
many of these discourses, which might be supposed
to be labored with all the slow attention of literary
leisure, were written in haste, as the moments pressed,
without even being read over by Johnson before they
were printed. Sir John Hawkins says that the original
manuscripts of the "Rambler" passed through
his hands, "and by the perusal of them I am warranted
to say, as was said of Shakespeare by the
players of his time, that he never blotted a line."
Johnson tells us that he wrote the life of Savage
in six-and-thirty hours. He also wrote his "Hermit
of Teneriffe" in a single night. When we consider
the amount of literary work performed by Johnson,
say in the period of seven years, while "he sailed a
long and painful voyage round the world of the English
language," and produced his dictionary, we must
give him credit for the most remarkable industry and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
great rapidity of production. During these seven
years he found time also to complete his "Rambler,"
the "Vanity of Human Wishes," and his tragedy,
besides several minor literary performances. No
wonder he developed hypochondria. Burke was a
very slow and painstaking producer; it is even said
that he had all his works printed at a private press
before submitting them to his publisher.</p>

<p>Hume was more rapid, even careless with his first
edition of a work, but went on correcting each new
one to the day of his death.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Macaulay, in his elaborate
speeches, did not write them out beforehand,
but <i>thought</i> them out, trusting to his memory to
recall every epigrammatic statement and every felicitous
epithet which he had previously forged in his
mind, so that when the time came for their delivery
they appeared to spring forth as the spontaneous outpouring
of his feelings and sentiments, excited by
the questions discussed. Wendell Phillips followed
a similar method.</p>

<p>Thomas Paine, the political and deistical writer,
was under contract to furnish a certain amount of
matter for each number of the "Pennsylvania Magazine."
Aitken the publisher had great difficulty in
getting him to fulfil his agreement. Paine's indo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>lence
was such that he was always behindhand with
his engagements. Finally, after it had become too
late to delay longer, Aitken would go to his house,
tell him the printers were standing idle waiting for
his copy, and insist upon his accompanying him to
the office. Paine would do so, when pen, ink, and
paper would be placed before him, and he would sit
thoughtfully, but produce nothing until Aitken gave
him a large glass of brandy. Even then he would
delay. The publisher naturally feared to give him
a second glass, thinking that it would disqualify him
altogether, but, on the contrary, his brain seemed to
be illumined by it, and when he had swallowed the
third glass,&mdash;quite enough to have made Mr. Aitken
dead drunk,&mdash;he would write with rapidity, intelligence,
and precision, his ideas appearing to flow faster
than he could express them on paper. The copy produced
under the fierce stimulant was remarkable for
correctness, and fit for the press without revision.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Charlotte Bronté was a very slow producer of literary
work, and was obliged to choose her special days.
Often for a week, and sometimes longer, she could
not write at all; her brain seemed to be dormant.
Then, without any premonition or apparent inducing
cause, she would awake in the morning, go to her
writing-desk, and the ideas would come with more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>rapidity than she could pen them. Mrs. Gaskell the
novelist, a friend of the Brontés, was exactly the
opposite in her style of composition. She could sit
down at any hour and lose herself in the process of
the story she was composing. She was also a prolific
authoress, of whom George Sand said: "She
has done what neither I nor other female writers in
France can accomplish; she has written novels which
excite the deepest interest in men of the world, and
which every girl will be the better for reading."
Bacon<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> often had music played in the room adjoining
his library, saying that he gathered inspiration from
its strains. Warburton said music was always a
necessity to him when engaged in intellectual labor.
Curran, the great Irish barrister, had also his favorite
mode of meditation; it was with his violin
in hand. He would seem to forget himself, running
voluntaries over the strings, while his imagination,
collecting its tones, was kindling and invigorating
all his faculties for the coming contest at the bar.
Bishop Beveridge adopted Bacon's plan, and said,
"When music sounds sweetest in my ears, truth
commonly flows the clearest in my mind." Even
the cold, passionless Carlyle said music was to him
a kind of inarticulate speech which led him to the
edge of the infinite, and permitted him for a moment
to gaze into it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>John Foster, the English essayist, declared that
the special quality of genius was "the power to light
its own fire;" and certainly Sir Walter Scott was
a shining example of this truth. Shelley, a poet of
finer but less robust fibre, decided that "the mind,
in creating, is as a fading coal, which some passing
influence, like an invisible wind, wakens into momentary
brightness."</p>

<p>As already remarked, ten years transpired between
the first sketch of the "Traveller," which was made
in Switzerland, and its publication; but the history of
the "Vicar of Wakefield" was quite different. Goldsmith
hastened the closing pages to raise money, being
terribly pressed for the payment of numerous small
bills, and also by his landlady for rent. He was
actually under arrest for this last debt, and sent to
Dr. Johnson to come to him at once. Understanding
very well what was the trouble, Johnson sent him a
guinea, and came in person as soon as he could. He
found, on arriving, that Goldsmith had already broken
the guinea and was drinking a bottle of wine purchased
therewith. The Doctor put the cork into the
bottle, and began to talk over the means of extricating
the impecunious author from his troubles. Goldsmith
told Johnson that he had just finished a small book,
and wished he would look at it; perhaps it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
bring in some money. He brought forth the manuscript
of the "Vicar of Wakefield." Johnson hastily
glanced over it, paused, read a chapter carefully, bade
Goldsmith to be of good cheer, and hastened away
with the new story to Newbury the publisher, who,
solely on Johnson's recommendation, gave him sixty
pounds for the manuscript and threw it into his desk,
where it remained undisturbed for two years.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>A voluminous writer once explained to Goldsmith
the advantage of employing an amanuensis. "How
do you manage it?" asked Goldsmith. "Why, I walk
about the room and dictate to a clever man, who puts
down very correctly all that I tell him, so that I have
nothing to do but to look it over and send it to the
printers." Goldsmith was delighted with the idea, and
asked his friend to send the scribe to him. The next
day the penman came with his implements, ready
to catch his new employer's words and to record
them. Goldsmith paced the room with great thoughtfulness,
just as his friend had described to him, back
and forth, back and forth, several times; but after
racking his brain to no purpose for half an hour, he
gave it up. He handed the scribe a guinea, saying,
"It won't do, my friend; I find that my head and
hand must work together."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>Milton dictated that immortal poem, "Paradise
Lost," his daughters being his amanuenses; but Milton
was then blind. It is said of Julius Cæsar that
while writing a despatch he could at the same time
dictate seven letters to as many clerks. This seems
almost miraculous; but in our own day Paul Morphy
has performed quite as difficult a feat at chess, playing
several games at once, blindfolded.</p>

<p>One of the most eminent and eloquent of American
preachers and lecturers, Thomas Starr King, was
accustomed to dictate to an amanuensis; but when a
difficulty would occur in developing his thought, he
would take the pen in his own hand, and, abstracting
himself entirely from the wondering reporter by his
side, would spend perhaps half an hour in deeper
thinking and more exact expression than when he
dictated. Those who have examined his manuscript
since his death easily perceive that the portions of a
sermon or a lecture which he personally wrote are
better than those which he poured forth to his amanuensis
as he walked the room. On one occasion a
friend who was in favor of making the pen and brain
work together went to hear Mr. King deliver a lecture
on Pope Gregory VII. (Hildebrand), and at its conclusion
told the lecturer that he could distinguish,
without seeing the manuscript, the portions he wrote
with his own hand from those he dictated. He succeeded
so well, in the course of half an hour's conversation,
as to surprise the orator by hitting on the
passages in dispute, and proving his case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>To write an acceptable book, poem, or essay, is
quite as much of a trade as to make a clock or shoe
a horse. To produce easy-flowing sentences, as they
finally appear before the reader's eye, has cost much
careful thought, long and patient practice, and even
with some famous authors, as we have seen, many
hours of writing and re-writing. So far as it is applied
to authorship, we are not surprised at Hogarth's
remark: "I know no such thing as genius; genius
is nothing but labor and diligence." Buffon's definition
is nearly the same; he says, "Genius is only
great patience." Authors are generally very commonplace
representatives of humanity, and remarkably
like the average citizen whom we meet in our
daily walk. Rogers, in his "Table Talk," says:
"When literature is the sole business of life, it becomes
a drudgery; when we are able to resort to it
only at certain hours, it is a charming relaxation. In
my early years I was a banker's clerk, obliged to
be at the desk every day from ten to five o'clock, and
I shall never forget the delight with which, on returning
home, I used to read and write during the
evening." He was a great reader, but said that "a
man who attempts to read all the new publications
must often do as a flea does&mdash;skip."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>To recur to Charles Dickens, is it generally known
that his favorite novel of "David Copperfield" partially
relates to the history of his own boyhood? The
story of David's employment, when a child, in washing
and labelling blacking-bottles in a London cellar,
was true of Dickens himself. If it were possible to
read between the lines, we should not infrequently
find the most effective narrative sketches little less
than biography or autobiography. Thackeray and
Dickens both wrote under the thin gauze of fiction.
"Vivian Gray" is but a photograph of its dilettante
author; and every character drawn by Charlotte
Bronté is a true portrait, all being confined within so
small a circle as to be easily recognizable. Smollett
sat for his own personality in that of Roderick
Random; while Scott drew many of his most strongly
individualized characters, like that of Dominie Sampson,
from people in his immediate circle.</p>

<p>Coleridge says of Milton: "In 'Paradise Lost,' indeed
in every one of his poems, it is Milton himself
whom you see. His Satan, his Adam, his Raphael,
almost his Eve, are all John Milton; and it is a
sense of this intense egotism that gives one the greatest
pleasure in reading Milton's works." It is
well known that many of Byron's<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> poetical plots are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>almost literally his personal experiences. This was
especially the case as to the "Giaour." A beautiful
female slave was thrown into the sea for infidelity,
and was terribly avenged by her lover, while Byron
was in the East; being impressed with the dramatic
character of the tragedy, he gave it expression in a
poem. Carlyle says that Satan was Byron's grand
exemplar, the hero of his poetry, and the model, apparently,
of his conduct. In Bulwer-Lytton's "Disowned,"
one of his earliest and best stories, the hero,
Clarence Linden, a youth of eighteen, while journeying
as a pedestrian, makes the acquaintance of a free-and-easy
person named Cole,&mdash;a gypsy king,&mdash;in whose
camp he passes the night: all of which was an actual
experience of Bulwer himself. Hans Christian Andersen
gives us many of his personal experiences in
his popular tale, "Only a Fiddler;" so is "Gilbert
Gurney," a novel by Theodore Hook, a biography of
himself as a practical joker. It will thus be seen that
authors do not always draw entirely upon the imagination
for incidents, characters, and plot, but that there
is from first to last a large amount of actual truth in
seeming fiction.</p>

<p>When Goldsmith was a lad of fifteen or there-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>about,
some one gave him a guinea, with which, and
a borrowed horse, he set out for a holiday trip. He
got belated when returning, and, inquiring of a
stranger if he would point out to him a house of
entertainment, was mischievously directed to the
residence of the sheriff of the county. Here he
knocked lustily at the door, and sending his horse
to the stable, ordered a good supper, inviting the
"landlord" to drink a bottle of wine with him. The
next morning, after an ample breakfast, he offered
his guinea in payment, when the squire, who knew
Goldsmith's family, overwhelmed him with confusion
by telling him the truth. Thirty years afterwards
Goldsmith availed himself of this humiliating blunder
at the time he wrote that popular comedy, "She
Stoops to Conquer." When Goldsmith was talking
to a friend of writing a fable in which little fishes
were to be introduced, Dr. Johnson, who was present,
laughed rather sneeringly. "Why do you laugh?"
asked Goldsmith, angrily. "If you were to write a
fable of little fishes, you would make them speak like
whales!" The justice of the reproof was perfectly
apparent to Johnson, who was conscious of Goldsmith's
superior inventiveness, lightness, and grace
of composition.</p>

<p>Speaking of authors writing from their own personal
experience recalls a name which we must not
neglect to mention. Laurence Sterne, author of
"Tristram Shandy," various volumes of sermons, the
"Sentimental Journey," etc., was a curious com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>pound
in character, but possessed of real genius. He
was quite a sentimentalist in his writings, and those
who did not know him personally would accredit him
with possessing a tender heart. The fact was, however,
as Horace Walpole said of him, "He had too
much sentiment to have any feeling." His mother,
who had run in debt on account of an extravagant
daughter, would have been permitted to remain indefinitely
in jail, but for the kindness of the parents of
her pupils. Her son Laurence heeded her not. "A
dead ass was more important to him than a living
mother," says Walpole. Sterne also used his wife
very ill. One day he was talking to Garrick in a fine
sentimental manner in praise of conjugal love and
fidelity. "The husband," said Sterne, "who behaves
unkindly to his wife, deserves to have his house
burned over his head." Garrick's reply was only
just: "If you think so, I hope <i>your</i> house is insured."
He is known to have been engaged to a
Miss Fourmantel for five years, and then to have
jilted her so cruelly that she ended her days in a mad-house.
Such was the great Laurence Sterne. It was
poetical justice that he should repent at leisure of
his subsequent hasty marriage to one whom he had
known only four weeks. He twice visited the lady
whom he had deceived, in the establishment where
she was confined; and the character of Maria, whom
he so pathetically describes, is drawn from her, showing
how cheaply he could coin his pretended feelings.
Contradictions in character are often ludicrous, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
go to show that the author and the man are seldom
one. What can be more contradictory in the nature
of the same individual than Sterne whining over a
dead ass and neglecting to relieve a living mother;
or Prior addressing the most romantic sonnets to his
Chloe, and at the same time indulging a sentimental
passion for a barmaid?</p>

<p>Goldsmith's "Deserted Village," according to Mr.
Best, an Irish clergyman, relates to the scenes in
which Goldsmith was himself an actor. Auburn is
a poetical name for the village of Lissoy, county of
Westneath. The name of the schoolmaster was
Paddy Burns. "I remember him well," says Mr.
Best; "he was indeed a man severe to view. A
woman called Walsey Cruse kept the ale-house. I
have often been within it. The hawthorn bush was
remarkably large, and stood in front of the ale-house."
The author of the "Deserted Village," however, made
his best contemporary "hit" with his poem of the
"Traveller." He always distrusted his poetic ability,
and this poem was kept on hand some years after it
was completed, before he published it in 1764. It
passed through several editions in the first year, and
proved a golden harvest to Newbury the publisher;
but Goldsmith received only twenty guineas for the
manuscript.</p>

<p>The character of Sober, in Johnson's "Idler," is
a portrait of himself; and he admitted more than
once that he had his own outset in life in his mind
when he wrote the Eastern story of "Gelaleddin."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Is not "Tristram Shandy" a synonym for its author,
Sterne? Hazlitt and many others fuse the personality
of the author of the "Imaginary Conversations" with
this admirable work from his pen: certainly a high
compliment to Landor, if the portraiture is a likeness.
Walter Savage Landor<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> was a most erratic genius, a
man of uncontrollable passions which led him into
constant difficulties; at times he must have been partially
deranged. In all his productions he exhibits
high literary culture; and being born to a fortune, he
was enabled to adapt himself to his most fastidious
tastes, though in the closing years of his life, having
lost his money, he learned the meaning of that bitter
word dependence. The severest critic must accord
him the genius of a poet; but his literar reputation
will rest upon his elaborate prose work, "Imaginary
Conversations" of literary men and statesmen, upon
which he was engaged for more than ten years. He
lived to the age of ninety, and found solace in his pen
to the last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p class="large center p4">CHAPTER III.</p>


<p>As we have already remarked, authors are very
much like other people, rarely coming up to the idea
formed of them by enthusiastic readers. They are
pretty sure to have some idiosyncrasies more or less
peculiar; and who, indeed, has not? To know the
true character of these individuals, we should see
them in their homes rather than in their books.</p>

<p>Having so lately spoken of Landor, we are reminded
of another literary character who in many
respects resembled him. William Beckford, the English
author, utterly despised literary fame, and when
he wrote he could afford to do so, for he was a millionnaire.
His romance of "Vathek," as an Eastern
tale, was pronounced by the critics superior to "Rasselas;"
and indeed "Rasselas, Prince of Abyssinia,"
is hardly in any sense an Eastern tale. "Johnson,"
says Macaulay, "not content with turning filthy savages,
ignorant of their letters and gorged with raw
steaks cut from living cows, into philosophers as eloquent
and enlightened as himself or his friend Burke,
and into ladies as accomplished as Mrs. Lennox or
Mrs. Sheridan, transferred the whole domestic system
of England to Egypt." Beckford read to Rogers one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of his novels in which the hero was a Frenchman who
was ridiculously fond of dogs, and in which his own
life was clearly depicted. Even this millionnaire author
was finally reduced to such necessity as obliged
him to sell his private pictures for subsistence. The
last which he disposed of was Bellini's portrait of the
"Doge of Venice," which was bought for and hung in
the National Gallery on the very day that Beckford
died, in 1844.</p>

<p>Certainly those authors who give us their own personal
experience as a basis for their sketches are no
plagiarists. The late Wendell Phillips<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> delighted, in
his lecture on the "Lost Arts," to prove that there was
nothing new under the sun; a not uncongenial task
for this "silver-tongued orator," who was an iconoclast
by nature. So early as the age of twenty-five
he relinquished the practice of the law because he
was unwilling to act under an oath to the Constitution
of the United States. In one sense there is
nothing new under the sun. Genius has not hesitated
to borrow bravely from history and legend. The
"Amphitrion" of Molière was adopted from Plautus,
who had borrowed it from the Greeks, and they from
the Indians. Any one reading a collection of the
Arabian stories for the first time will be surprised
at meeting so many which are familiar, and which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>had thought to be of modern birth. La Fontaine
borrowed from Petronius the "Ephesian Matron,"
which had been taken from Greek annals, having
been previously transferred from the Arabic, where
it appeared taken from the Chinese. There is no
ignoring the fact that a large portion of our plots
belonged originally to Eastern nations. The graceful,
attractive, and patriotic story of William Tell
was proven by the elder son of Haller, a century ago,
to have been, in the main features, but the revival of a
Danish story to be found in Saxo Grammaticus. The
interesting legend of the apple was but a fable revived.
The English story of Whittington and his
Cat was common two thousand years ago in Persia.</p>

<p>When the writer of these pages visited the grand
temples of Nikko, in the interior of Japan, he was
told that the wonderfully preserved carvings beneath
the eaves and on the inner walls, thousands of years
old, were executed by one who was known as the
"Left-Handed Artist," who was a dwarf, and had but
partial use of the right hand. It seems, according to
the local legend preserved for so many centuries, that
while this artist was working at the ornamentation
of the temples at Nikko he saw and fell in love with
a beautiful Japanese girl resident in the city; for
Nikko was then a city of half a million, though now
but a straggling village. The girl would have nothing
to do with the artist, on account of his deformity
of person. All his attempts to win her affection
were vain; she was inflexible. Finally the heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>-broken
artist returned to Tokio, his native place.
Here be carved in wood a life-size figure of his
beloved, so perfect and beautiful that the gods endowed
it with life, and the sculptor lived with it
as his wife, in the enjoyment of mutual love, all the
rest of his days. Here, then, in Japan, we have the
legend upon which the Greek story of Pygmalion and
Galatea is undoubtedly founded.</p>

<p>As regards the subject of plagiarism in general,
which is so often spoken of as connected with literary
productions, it should be remembered, as Ruskin says,
that all men who have sense and feeling are being
constantly helped. They are taught by every person
whom they meet, and enriched by everything that
falls in their way. The greatest is he who has been
oftenest aided.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> "Literature is full of coincidences,"
says Holmes, "which some love to believe plagiarisms.
There are thoughts always abroad in the air, which it
takes more wit to avoid than to hit upon."</p>

<p>It has been truthfully said that no man is quite
sane; each one has a vein of folly in his composition,
a view which would certainly seem to be illustrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>by circumstances which are easily recalled. Take,
for instance, the fact that Schiller<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> could not write
unless surrounded by the scent of decayed apples,
with which he kept one drawer of his writing-desk
well filled. Could we have a clearer instance of monomania?
He also required his cup of strong coffee
when he was composing, and the coffee was well
"laced" with brandy. Bulwer-Lytton, in his life of
Schiller, declares that when he wrote at night he
drank hock wine. As an opposite and much more
agreeable habit, we have that of Méhul, the French
composer, and author of over forty successful operas,
who could not produce a note of original music except
amid the perfume of roses. His table, writing-desk,
and piano were constantly covered with them;
in this delicious atmosphere he produced his "Joseph
in Egypt," which alone would have entitled him to
undying fame.</p>

<p>Father Sarpi, who was Macaulay's favorite historian,
best known as the author of the "History of the
Council of Trent," having the idea that the atmosphere
immediately about him became in a degree
impregnated with the mental electricity of his brain,
was accustomed to build a paper enclosure about his
head and person while he was writing. "All air is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>predatory," he said. Salieri, the Venetian composer,
prepared himself for writing by filling a capacious
dish at his side with candy and bonbons, which he
consumed in large quantities during the process.
Sarti, the well-known composer of sacred music, was
obliged to work in the dark, or thought that he was,
as daylight or artificial light of any sort at such
moments utterly disconcerted him. Rossini, on the
contrary, seemed to have no special ideas about his
surroundings when he was in a mood for composing.
He sat down among his friends, laughing and talking
all the while that he was creating, and framing with
marvellous rapidity strains that will live for all time.
The whole of "Tancredi," which first made his fame,
was produced in the very midst of social life and
merry companionship. He said he found inspiration
in the cheerful human voices about him. As to the
peculiarities we have noted in others, they must at
first have been mere affectations; but such is the
force of habit, that no doubt these individuals became
confirmed in them and really believed their indulgence
a necessity.</p>

<p>Carneades, the Greek philosopher, so famed for his
subtle and powerful eloquence, before sitting down to
write dosed himself with hellebore,&mdash;a strange resort,
as it is supposed to act directly upon the liver, and
only very slightly to stimulate the brain, besides being
a fatal poison in large doses. It is well known that
Dryden resorted to singular aids as preparatory to
literary composition; being in the habit of first having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
himself bled and then making a meal of raw meat.
The former process, he contended, rendered his brain
clear, and the latter stimulated his imagination. In
1668 he held the position now filled by Tennyson, as
poet-laureate of England. He was a notable instance
of power in poetry, satire, and indecency, whom Cowper
characterized as a lewd writer but a chaste companion.
Dryden's own couplet will forcibly apply to
himself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"O gracious God! how far have we<br />
Profaned thy heavenly gift of poesy!"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>His "Essay on Dramatic Poesy," according to Dr.
Johnson, entitled him to be considered the father of
English criticism. His dramas, such as "Mariage
à-la-Mode," "All for Love," "Don Sebastian," etc.,
were, by reason of their indecency, examples of perverted
genius. He was sixty-six years old when he
wrote his "Alexander's Feast," by far his best literary
effort. While Macaulay calls him "an illustrious
renegade,"<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Dr. Johnson says, "he found the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>language brick and left it marble,"&mdash;a most superlative
and ridiculous comment to be made by so
erudite a critic.</p>

<p>When James Francis Stephens, the English entomologist,
was about to write, he mounted a horse
and arranged his thoughts and sentences while at
full gallop. This was a plan that Sir Walter Scott
also adopted when he wrote "Marmion," galloping
up and down the shore of the Firth of Forth. But he
concluded that he could do better pen-work in a more
rational manner, so this practice did not become
habitual with him. Scott made an interesting confession
when writing the third volume of "Woodstock."
He declared that he had not the slightest
idea how the story was to be wound up to a catastrophe.
He said he could never lay out a plan for a
novel and stick to it. "I only tried to make that
which I wrote diverting and interesting, leaving the
rest to fate." Sir David Dalrymple (afterwards Lord
Hailes) was a voluminous author on historical and
antiquarian subjects.  His "Annals of Scotland,"
published in 1792, was his most important work; Dr.
Johnson called it "a book which will always sell, it
has such a stability of dates, such a certainty of facts,
and such punctuality of citation." Lord Hailes's
mode of writing was very domestic, so to speak, being
performed by the parlor fire, and amid his family
circle of wife and children. He was always ready to
answer any appeal, however trifling, and to enter
cheerfully into all current family affairs. This seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
hardly reconcilable with the extreme nicety and absolute
correctness of his work.</p>

<p>Cormontaigne, the French military engineer, wrote
an elaborate treatise on fortification in the trenches
and while under fire. The Duke of Wellington,
when his army was at San Christoval awaiting battle
with the French, wrote a complete essay on the purpose
of establishing a bank at Lisbon after the English
methods. Thomas Hood wrote at night, when
the house was still and the children asleep. Ouida<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
writes with her dogs only as companions, while they
lie contentedly at her feet in the bright sunny library
whose windows overlook the valley of the Arno and
her well-beloved Florence. In the flower-garden
before the villa her favorite Newfoundland dog, not
long since dead, lies buried beneath a marble monument.
Her productive literary capacity is wonderfully
rapid, but the demand far exceeds it, and the prices
she receives are unprecedented. She has few if any
intimate friends, and no confidants, leading a life of
almost perfect isolation.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding common-sense and experience have
ever taught that the brain is capable of producing
its best work when in its normal condition, still a
host of writers have resorted systematically to some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>sort of artificial stimulant to aid them in authorship.
History tells us that Æschylus, Eupolis, Cratinus, and
Ennius, in the olden time, would not attempt to compose
until they had become nearly intoxicated with
wine. In more modern times, we know that Shadwell,
De Quincey, Psalmanazar the famous literary impostor,
Coleridge, Robert Hall, and Bishop Horsley
stimulated themselves with fabulous doses of opium.
Alfred de Musset, Burns, Edgar A. Poe, Dickens,
Christopher North, and a host of others whose names
will only too readily occur to the reader, were reckless
as to the use of alcohol. They were both fed and
consumed by stimulants. We are inclined, however,
to forgive much of indiscretion in a brilliant and ardent
imagination. Schiller, so lately referred to, was
addicted to Rhenish wine in large quantities. Blackstone,
author of "Commentaries on the Laws of
England," remarkable for his clearness and purity
of style, never wrote without a bottle of port by his
side, which he emptied at a sitting.</p>

<p>It is related of Bacon that he did not drink wine
when engaged in pen-craft, but he was accustomed
to have sherry poured into a broad open vessel, and to
inhale its fragrance with great relish. He believed
that his brain thus received the stimulating influence
without the narcotic effect. Sheridan could neither
write nor talk until warmed by wine. If about to
make a speech in the House, he would, just before
rising, swallow half a tumbler of raw brandy. Burke
presents a remarkable contrast; his great stimulant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
being <i>hot water</i>. The most impassioned passages of
his speeches had no other physical inspiration; all the
rest came from his glowing soul, which was powerful
enough to vitalize his body for an oration of four hours'
length. The food which sustained him on such occasions
was <i>cold</i> mutton, the drink being <i>hot</i> water.
Brandy and port, even claret and champagne, would
have driven him wild, though they were the ordinary
stimulants of his contemporaries. Burke was, like
Burns, a man of an excitable temperament; but, unlike
Burns, he was wise enough to avoid all dangerous
alcoholic excitements, which increased the impulsive
elements of his nature and diminished the action
of his reason. It will be observed that even in the
occasional violence of his invective, his passion is
still reasoned passion, or reason penetrated by passion,
so as to reach the will as well as to convince the
understanding.</p>

<p>Addison, with his bottle of wine at each end of the
long gallery at Holland House, where he walked back
and forth perfecting his thoughts, will be sure to be
recalled by the reader in this connection. Consciously
or unconsciously he took a glass of the stimulant at
each turn, until wrought up to the required point.
Dr. Radcliffe, the eminent London physician and
author, was often found in an over-stimulated condition.
Summoned one evening to a lady patient, he
found that he was too much inebriated to count her
pulse, and so muttered, "Drunk! dead drunk!" and
hastened homeward. The next morning, while ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>periencing
intense mortification over the recollection,
he received a note from the same patient, in which
she said, she knew only too well her own condition
when he called, and begged him to keep the matter
secret, enclosing a hundred-pound note.</p>

<p>Burns was wont oftentimes to compose, as he tells
us, "by the lee side of a bowl of punch, which had
overset every mortal in the company except the haut-boy
and the Muse."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Of course "the pernicious expedient
of stimulants," as Carlyle would say, only served
to use up more rapidly his already wasted physical
strength. Sometimes, however, Burns would compose
walking in the open fields. His first effort was
to master some pleasing air, and then he easily produced
appropriate words for it. One noble trait of
Burns's character should not be forgotten. Though
he died in abject poverty, he did not leave a farthing
of debt owed to any one. Nothing could be finer than
Carlyle's exordium in his review of Lockhart's "Life
of Burns:" "With our readers in general, with men
of right feeling anywhere, we are not required to plead
for Burns. In pitying admiration he lies enshrined
in all our hearts, in a far nobler mausoleum than that
one of marble; neither will his works ever as they
are, pass away from the memory of men. While the
Shakspeares and Miltons roll on like mighty rivers
through the country of Thought, bearing fleets of
traffickers and assiduous pearl-fishers on their waves,
this little Valclusa Fountain will also arrest our eye;
for this also is of Nature's own and most cunning
workmanship, bursts from the depths of the earth,
with a full gushing current, into the light of day; and
often will the traveller turn aside to drink of its clear
waters, and muse among its rocks and pines."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p>As we have seen, musical composers, like those
devoted to literature, are apt to have singular fancies.
Glück, who was at one time the music-teacher of
Marie Antoinette, and whose operas have entitled him
to a niche in the temple of fame, could compose only
while under the influence of champagne, two bottles
of which he would consume at a sitting. He was an
eccentric individual, singing and acting the part for
which he at the same time wrote the music. Handel,
when he felt the inspiration of music upon him, sought
the graveyard of some village church, and on the
moss-grown stones laid his portfolio and wrote his
notes, never trying their harmony until he had completed
the entire piece. It seems strange to us, in the
light of his great genius, to think what an immense
glutton Handel was. We have already spoken of
this, but recur to it again in this connection; for
one is puzzled how to reconcile the grossness of his
appetite with his æsthetic nature. He could devour
more food at one dinner than any other composer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
three.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Never before was height and breadth of
musical genius combined with such enormous appetite
for the good things of the table; and yet his
digestion was as sound as his love and need of food
was portentous. Everything about this great composer
was gigantesque, as became a giant. His forgetive
brain was recruited by the nourishment drawn
from a ravenous yet healthy stomach.</p>

<p>Unlike Handel's mode of composition, Mozart
played his music upon the harpsichord before he
wrote a note of it upon paper; but he had a most
exalted idea of his mission, and prepared himself
for composition, not by partaking of a hearty dinner,
but by reading favorite classic authors for hours
before beginning what was to him a sacred task.
His favorite authors on such occasions were Dante
and Petrarch. He chose the morning for his compositions;
but he would often delay writing his
scores for the musicians until it was too late to copy
them, and sometimes failed altogether to write out
the part intended to be performed by himself; yet
when the moment arrived, so perfectly had all been
arranged in his mind, he played it without hesitation,
instrument in hand. The Emperor Joseph,
before whom he was performing on one occasion,
observed that the music-sheet before him contained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>no characters whatever, and asked, "Where is
your part?" "Here," replied Mozart, pointing with
his finger to his forehead.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> He became blind before
he was forty years of age, but continued to compose.
The duet and chorus in "Judas Maccabæus," and
some others of his finest efforts were produced after
his total deprivation of sight; nor did he cease to
conduct his oratorios in public on account of his
blindness.</p>

<p>Spontini, the Italian composer, like Sarti, could only
produce his music in the dark, dictating to some
one sitting in an adjoining room. Rossini, author
of the "Barber of Seville," composed his music as
the elder Dumas was accustomed to write; namely,
in bed. Offenbach, of opera-bouffe notoriety, almost
lived on coffee while creating his dainty aerial music.
The writer of these pages met this composer in Paris
in 1873, when he was at the height of his popularity,
and was told by him that he took no wine or spirit
until <i>after</i> his work of composition was completed.
Cimarosa, the Italian composer, who won national fame
before he was twenty-five, derived his inspiration from
the noisy crowd. Auber, the French composer, could
write only among the green fields and the silence of the
country. Sacchini, another Italian composer, lost the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>thread of his inspiration unless attended by his favorrite
cats, they sitting all about him while he worked,
some upon the table, some on the floor, and one
always perched contentedly between his shoulders on
his neck; he declared that their purring was to him a
soothing anodyne, and fitted him for composition by
making him content. Eugène Sue would not take
up his pen except in full dress and with white kids
on his hands. Thus he produced the "Mysteries of
Paris," which Dumas designated as "one-gross-of-gloves
long." Buffon would only sit down to write
after taking a bath and donning pure linen with
a full frilled bosom. Haydn<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> declared that he
could not compose unless he wore the large seal-ring
which Frederick the Great had given him. He would
sit wrapped in silence for an hour or more, after
which he would seize his pen and write rapidly without
touching a musical instrument; and he rarely
altered a line. In early life, poor, freezing in a miserable
garret, he studied the rudiments of his favorite
art by the side of an old broken harpsichord.
For a period of six years he endured a bitter conflict
with poverty, being often compelled for the sake
of warmth to lie in bed most of the day as well as
the night. Finally he was relieved from this thraldom
by the generosity of his patron, Prince Esterhazy,
a passionate lover of music, who appointed him
his chapel-master, with a salary sufficient to keep
him supplied with the ordinary comforts of life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>Crébillon the elder, a celebrated lyric poet and
member of the French Academy, was enamoured of
solitude, and could only write effectively under such
circumstances. His imagination teemed with romances,
and he produced eight or ten dramas which
enjoyed popularity in their day,&mdash;about 1776. One
day, when he was alone and in a deep reverie, a friend
entered his study hastily. "Don't disturb me," cried
the author, "I am enjoying a moment of happiness:
I am going to hang a villain of a minister, and banish
another who is an idiot."</p>

<p>We have lately mentioned Dumas. Hans Christian
Andersen, speaking of the various habits of authors,
thus refers to the elder Dumas, with whom he was
intimate: "I generally found him in bed, even long
after mid-day, where he lay, with pen, ink, and paper
by his side, and wrote his newest drama. On entering
his apartment I found him thus one day; he
nodded kindly to me, and said: 'Sit down a minute.
I have just now a visit from my Muse; she will
be going directly.' He wrote on, and after a brief
silence shouted '<i>Vivat</i>' sprang out of bed, and said,
'The third act is finished!'"<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>Lamartine was peculiar in his mode of composition,
and never saw his productions, after the first draft,
until they were printed, bound, and issued to the public.
He was accustomed to walk forth in his park
during the after part of the day, or of a moonlit
evening, with pencil and pieces of paper, and whatever
ideas struck him he recorded. That was the
end of the matter so far as he was concerned. These
pieces of paper he threw into a special box, without
a number or title upon them. His literary secretary
with much patient ability assorted these papers,
arranged them as he thought best, and sold them to
the publishers at a royal price. We know of no similar
instance where authorship and recklessness combined
have produced creditable results. Certainly
such indifference argued only the presence of weakness
and irresponsibility, which were indeed prominent
characteristics of Lamartine.</p>

<p>The remarkable facility with which Goethe's poems
were produced is said to have resembled improvisation,
an inspiration almost independent of his own purposes.
"I had come," he says, "to regard the poetic talent
dwelling in me entirely as nature; the rather that
I was directed to look upon external nature as its
proper subject. The exercise of this poetic gift might
be stimulated and determined by occasion, but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>flowed forth more joyfully and richly, when it came
involuntarily, or even against my will." Addison,
whose style is perhaps the nearest to perfection in
ancient or modern literature, did not reach that standard
without much patient labor. Pope tells us that
"he would show his verses to several friends, and
would alter nearly everything that any of them hinted
was wrong. He seemed to be distrustful of himself,
and too much concerned about his character as a poet,
or, as he expressed it, 'too solicitous for that kind of
praise which God knows is a very little matter after
all.'" Pope himself published nothing until it had
been a twelvemonth on hand, and even then the printer's
proofs were full of alterations. On one occasion
this was carried so far that Dodsley, his publisher,
thought it better to have the whole recomposed than
to attempt to make the necessary alterations. Yet
Pope admits that "the things that I have written
fastest have always pleased the most. I wrote the
'Essay on Criticism' fast, for I had digested all the
matter in prose before I began it in verse."</p>

<p>"I never work better," says Luther, "than when I
am inspired by anger: when I am angry, I can write,
pray, and preach well; for then my whole temperament
is quickened, my understanding sharpened, and
all mundane vexations and temptations depart."
We are reminded of Burke's remark in this connection:
"A vigorous mind is as necessarily accompanied
with violent passions as a great fire with
great heat." Luther, however ribald he may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
been at times, had the zeal of honesty. There was
not a particle of vanity or self-sufficiency in the great
reformer. "Do not call yourselves Lutherans," he
said to his followers; "call yourselves Christians.
Who and what is Luther? Has Luther been crucified
for the world?"</p>

<p>Churchill,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> the English poet and satirist, was so
averse to correcting and blotting his manuscript that
many errors were unexpunged, and many lines which
might easily have been improved were neglected.
When expostulated with upon this subject by his publisher,
he replied that erasures were to him like cutting
away so much of his flesh; thus expressing his
utter repugnance to an author's most urgent duty.
Though Macaulay tells us that his vices were not so
great as his virtues, still he was dissipated and licentious.
Cowper was a great admirer of his poetry, and
called him "the great Churchill." George Wither,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
the English poet, satirist, and political writer, was
compelled to watch and fast when he was called upon
to write. He "went out of himself," as he said, at
such times, and if he tasted meat or drank one glass
of wine he could not produce a verse or sentence.</p>

<p>Rogers, who wrote purely <i>con amore</i>, took all the
time to perfect his work which his fancy dictated, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>certainly over-refined many of his compositions. The
"Pleasures of Memory" occupied him seven years.
In writing, composing, re-writing, and altering his
"Columbus" and "Human Life," each required just
double that period of time before the fastidious author
felt satisfied to call it finished. Besides this, the
second edition of each went through another series
of emendations. The observant reader will find that
Rogers has often weakened his first and best thoughts
by this elaboration. The expression of true genius
oftenest comes, like the lightning, in its full power
and effect at the first flash. "Every event that a man
would master," says Holmes, "must be mounted on
the run, and no man ever caught the reins of a thought
except as it galloped by him." One who has had
years of active editorial experience on the daily press
can hardly conceive of such fastidious slowness of
composition as characterizes some authors. Sir Joshua
Reynolds, in speaking of Rogers, Rochefoucauld, Cowper,
and others, and their dilatory habits of composition,
says, that although men of ordinary talents
may be highly satisfied with their productions, men of
genius never are,&mdash;an assumption which is not borne
out by facts, as we shall have occasion to show in
these chapters. Modesty is not always the characteristic
of genius; and very few popular writers are without
a due share of vanity in their natures.</p>

<p>Voltaire somewhere says that an author should
write with the rapidity which genius inspires, but
should correct with care and deliberation; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
doubtless expresses the process adopted by this unscrupulous
but versatile writer, of whom Carlyle said:
"With the single exception of Luther, there is perhaps,
in these modern ages, no other man of a merely
intellectual character, whose influence and reputation
have become so entirely European as that of Voltaire."
Sydney Smith was so rapid a producer that he had
not patience even to read over his compositions when
finished. He would throw down his manuscript and
say: "There, it is done; now, Kate, do look it over,
and put dots to the <i>i's</i> and strokes to the <i>t's</i>." He
was once advised by a fashionable publisher to attempt
a three-volume novel. "Well," said he, after some
seeming consideration, "if I do so, I must have an
archdeacon for my hero, to fall in love with the pew-opener,
with the clerk for a confidant; tyrannical
interference of the church-wardens; clandestine correspondence
concealed under the hassock; appeal
to the parishioners," etc. He was overflowing with
humor to the very close of life. He wrote to Lady
Carlisle during his last illness, saying, "If you hear of
sixteen or eighteen pounds of human flesh, they belong
to <i>me</i>. I look as if a curate had been taken out
of me."</p>

<p>Buffon caused his "Époques de la Nature" to be
copied eighteen times, so many corrections and changes
were made. As he was then (1778) over seventy
years of age, one would think this an evidence that his
mind was failing him. Pope covered with memoranda
every scrap of clear paper which came in his way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Some of his most elaborate literary work was begun
and finished on the backs of old letters and bits of
yellow wrappers. We do not wonder that such fragmentary
manuscript always suggested the idea of
revision and correction. It is difficult to understand
why Pope should have assumed this small virtue of
economy and yet often have been lavish in other
directions; indeed, it may be questioned whether it
was intended to be an act of economy. Such petty
parsimony is inexplicable, but certainly it grew into
a fixed habit with him. We believe it was Swift who
first called him "paper-saving Pope;" but Swift was
nearly as eccentric a paper-saver as Pope. He wrote
to Dr. Sheridan: "Keep very regular accounts, in
large books and a fair hand; not like me, who, to
save paper, confuse everything!" Miss Mitford had
the same habit of writing upon waste scraps of paper,
fly-leaves of books, envelopes, and odd rejected bits,
all in so small a hand as to be nearly illegible.
William Hazlitt was also remarkable for the same
practice, and we are told that he even made the first
outline of some of his essays on the walls of his chamber,
much to the annoyance of his landlady.</p>

<p>Some idea of the rapidity with which Byron wrote
may be inferred from the fact that the "Prisoner of
Chillon" was written in two days and sent away
complete to the printer. The traveller in Switzerland
does not fail to visit the house&mdash;once a wayside
inn, at Merges, on the Lake of Geneva&mdash;where
Byron wrote this poem while detained by a rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>storm,
in 1816. On the heights close at hand is
the Castle of Wuffens, dating back to the tenth century.
Morges is a couple of leagues from Lausanne,
and the spot where Gibbon finished his "Rise and
Fall of the Roman Empire," in 1787. Colton, the
philosophical but erratic author of "Lacon," wrote
that entire volume upon covers of letters and such
small scraps of paper as happened to be at hand
when a happy thought inspired him. Having completed
a sentence, and rounded it to suit his fancy,
he threw it into a pile with hundreds of others,
which were finally turned over to the printer in a
cloth bag. No classification or system of arrangement
was observed. Colton exhibited all the singularities
that only too often characterize genius,
especially as regards improvidence and recklessness
of habit. He lived unattended, in a single room in
Princes Street, Soho, London, in a neglected apartment
containing scarcely any furniture. He wrote
very illegibly upon a rough deal table with a stumpy
pen. He was finally so pressed with debts that he absconded
to avoid his London creditors, though he held
the very comfortable vicarage of Kew, in Surrey.</p>

<p>Montaigne, the French philosopher and essayist,
whose writings have been translated into every modern
tongue, like the musician Sacchini was marvellously
fond of cats, and would not sit down to write
without his favorite by his side. Thomas Moore required
complete isolation when he did literary work,
and shut himself up, as did Charles Dickens. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
was a very slow and painstaking producer. Some
friend having congratulated him upon the seeming
facility and appropriateness with which a certain line
was introduced into a poem he had just published,
Moore replied, "Facility! that line cost me hours
of patient labor to achieve." His verses, which read
so smoothly, and which appear to have glided so
easily from his pen, were the result of infinite labor
and patience. His manuscript, like Tennyson's, was
written, amended, rewritten, and written again, until
it was finally satisfactory to his critical ear and fancy.
"Easy writing," said Sheridan, "is commonly damned
hard reading."</p>

<p>Bishop Warburton tells us that he could "only
write in a hand-to-mouth style" unless he had all
his books about him; and that the blowing of an east
wind, or a fit of the spleen, incapacitated him for
literary work; and still another English bishop could
write only when in full canonicals, a fact which he
frankly admitted. Milton would not attempt to compose
except between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes,
at which season his poetry came as if by inspiration,
and with scarcely a mental effort.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Thomson,
Collins, and Gray entertained very similar ideas, which
when expressed so incensed Dr. Johnson that he
publicly ridiculed them. Crabbe fancied that there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>was something in the effect of a sudden fall of snow
that in an extraordinary manner stimulated him to
poetic composition; while Lord Orrery found no
stimulant equal to a fit of the gout!&mdash;all of which
fancies are but mild forms of monomania. James
Hogg (the Ettrick Shepherd) was only too glad to
write without any of these accessories, when he could
get any material to write upon. He used to employ
a bit of slate, for want of the necessary paper and
ink. The son of an humble Scottish farmer, he experienced
all sorts of misfortunes in his endeavors
to pursue literature as a calling. He was both a
prose and poetic writer of considerable native genius,
and formed one of the well-drawn characters of
Christopher North's "Noctes Ambrosianæ." N. P.
Willis in the latter years of his life was accustomed
to ride on horseback before he sat down to write. He
believed there was a certain nervo-vital influence imparted
from the robust health and strength of the animal
to the rider, as he once told the writer of these
pages; and, so far as one could judge, the influence
upon himself certainly favored such a conclusion.</p>

<p>Some authors frankly acknowledge that they have
not the necessary degree of patience to apply themselves
to the correction of their manuscripts. Ovid,
the popular Roman poet, admitted this. Such people
may compose with pleasure, but there is the end;
neither a sense of responsibility nor a desire for correctness
can overcome their constitutional laziness.
Pope, Dryden, Moore, Coleridge, Swift,&mdash;in short, nine-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>tenths
of the popular authors of the past and the
present, all change, correct, amplify, or contract,
and interline more or less every page of manuscript
which they produce, and often to such a degree as
greatly to confuse the compositors. Richard Savage,
the unfortunate English poet, could not, or would
not, bring himself to correct his faulty sentences,
being greatly indebted to the intelligence of the
proof-reader for the presentable form in which his
writings finally appeared. Julius Scaliger, a celebrated
scholar and critic, was, on the other hand, an
example of remarkable correctness, so that his manuscript
and the printer's pages corresponded exactly,
page for page and line for line. Hume,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> the historian,
was never done with his manifold corrections;
his sense of responsibility was unlimited, and his
appreciation of his calling was grand. Fénelon and
Gibbon were absolutely correct in their first efforts;
and so was Adam Smith, though he dictated to an
amanuensis.</p>

<p>We are by no means without sympathy for those
writers who dread and avoid the reperusal and correction
of their manuscripts. Only those who are familiar
with the detail of book-making can possibly
realize its trying minutiæ. When one has finished
the composition and writing of a chapter, his work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>is only begun; it must be read and re-read with
care, to be sure of absolute correctness. When once
in type, it must be again carefully read for the correction
of printer's errors, and again revised by second
proof; and finally a third proof is necessary, to
make sure that all errors previously marked have
been corrected. By this time, however satisfactory
in composition, the text becomes "more tedious than
a twice-told tale." Any author must be singularly
conceited who can, after such experience, take up a
chapter or book of his own production and read it
with any great degree of satisfaction. Godeau, Bishop
of Venice, used to say that "to compose is an author's
heaven; to correct, an author's purgatory; but to
revise the press, an author's hell!"</p>

<p>Guido Reni, whose superb paintings are among
the gems of the Vatican, in the height of his fame
would not touch pencil or brush except in full
dress. He ruined himself by gambling and dissolute
habits, and became lost as to all ambition for
that art which had been so grand a mistress to him in
the beginning. He finally arrived at that stage where
he lost at the gaming-table and in riotous living what
he earned by contract under one who managed his
affairs, giving him a stipulated sum for just so much
daily work in his studio. Such was the famous
author of that splendid example of art, the "Martyrdom
of Saint Peter," in the Vatican. Parmigiano,
the eminent painter, was full of the wildness of genius.
He became mad after the philosopher's stone, jilting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
art as a mistress, though his eager creditors forced
him to set once more to work, though to little effect.</p>

<p>Great painters, like great writers, have had their
peculiar modes of producing their effects. Thus Domenichino
was accustomed to assume and enact before
the canvas the passion and character he intended to
depict with the brush. While engaged upon the "Martyrdom
of Saint Andrew," Caracci, a brother painter,
came into his studio and found him in a violent
passion. When this fit of abstraction had passed,
Caracci embraced him, admitting that Domenichino
had proved himself his master, and that he had
learned from him the true manner of expressing sentiment
or passion upon the canvas.</p>

<p>Richard Wilson, the eminent English landscape-painter,
strove in vain, he said, to paint the motes
dancing in the sunshine. A friend coming into his
studio found the artist sitting dejected on the floor,
looking at his last work. The new-comer examined
the canvas and remarked critically that it looked like
a broad landscape just after a shower. Wilson started
to his feet in delight, saying, "That is the effect I
intended to represent, but thought I had failed."
Poor Wilson possessed undoubted genius, but neglected
his art for brandy, and was himself neglected
in turn. He was one of the original members of the
Royal Academy.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, genius is at times nonplussed and at
fault, like plain humanity, and is helped out of a
temporary dilemma by accident,&mdash;as when Poussin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
the painter, having lost all patience in his fruitless
attempts to produce a certain result with the brush,
impatiently dashed his sponge against the canvas and
brought out thereby the precise effect desired; namely,
the foam on a horse's mouth.</p>

<p>Washington Allston<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> is recalled to us in this connection,
one of the most eminent of our American
painters, and a poet of no ordinary pretensions.
"The Sylphs of the Seasons and other Poems" was
published in 1813. He was remarkable for his
graphic and animated conversational powers, and was
the warm personal friend of Coleridge and Washington
Irving. Irving says, "His memory I hold in reverence
and affection as one of the purest, noblest, and
most intellectual beings that ever honored me with
his friendship." While living in London he was
elected associate of the Royal Academy. Bostonians
are familiar with Allston's half-finished picture of
"Belshazzar's Feast," upon which he was engaged
when death snatched him from his work.</p>

<p class="large center p4">CHAPTER IV.</p>


<p>It has been said that the first three men in the
world were a gardener, a ploughman, and a grazier;
while all political economists admit that the real
wealth and stamina of a nation must be looked for
among the cultivators of the soil. Was it not Swift
who declared that the man who could make two ears
of corn or two blades of grass grow upon a spot of
ground where only one grew before, deserved better of
mankind than the whole race of politicians? Bacon,
Cowley, Sir William Temple, Buffon, and Addison
were all attached to horticulture, and more or less
time was devoted by them to the cultivation of trees
and plants of various sorts; nor did they fail to record
the refined delight and the profit they derived
therefrom. Daniel Webster was an enthusiastic agriculturist;
so were Washington, Adams, Jefferson,
Walter Scott, Horace Greeley, Gladstone, Evarts,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
Wilder, Loring, Poore, and a host of other contemporaneous
and noted men. "They who labor in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>the earth," said Jefferson, "are the chosen people
of God."</p>

<p>But the habits and mode of composition adopted by
literary men still crowd upon the memory. Hobbes,
the famous English philosopher, author of a "Treatise
on Human Nature," a political work entitled the
"Leviathan," etc., was accustomed to compose in the
open air. The top of his walking-stick was supplied
with pen and inkhorn, and he would pause anywhere
to record his thoughts in the note-book always carried
in his pocket. Virgil rose early in the morning and
wrote at a furious rate innumerable verses, which he
afterwards pruned and altered and polished, as he said,
after the manner of a bear licking her cubs into shape.
The Earl of Roscommon, in his "Essay on Translated
Verse," declared this to be the duty of the poet,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"To write with fury and correct with phlegm."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Darwin, the ingenious English poet, wrote his
works, like some others of whom we have spoken, on
scraps of paper with a pencil while travelling. His
old-fashioned sulky was so full of books as to give
barely room for him to sit and to carry a well-stored
hamper of fruits and sweetmeats, of which he was
immoderately fond.</p>

<p>Rousseau tells us that he composed in bed at night,
or else out of doors while walking, carefully recording
his ideas in his brain, arranging and turning them
many times until they satisfied him, and then he
committed them to paper perfected. He said it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in vain for him to attempt to compose at a table surrounded
by books and all the usual accessories of an
author. Irving wrote most of the "Stout Gentleman"
mounted on a stile at Stratford-on-Avon, while his
friend Leslie, the painter, was engaged in taking
sketches of the interesting locality. Jane Taylor, the
English poetess and prose writer, began to produce
creditable work at a very early age, and used at first
to compose tales and dramas while whipping a top,
committing them to paper at the close of that somewhat
trivial exercise. As she grew older she said
that she could find mental inspiration only from outdoor
exercise.</p>

<p>Petavius, the learned Jesuit, when composing his
"Theologica Dogmata" and other works, would leave
his table and pen at the end of every other hour to
twirl his chair, first with one hand, then with the other,
for ten minutes, by way of exercise. Cardinal Richelieu
resorted to jumping in his garden, and in bad
weather leaped over the chairs and tables indoors,&mdash;an
exercise which seemed to have a special charm
for him. Samuel Clark, the English philosopher and
mathematician, adopted Richelieu's plan of exercise
when tired of continuous writing. Pope says, with
regard to exercise, "I, like a poor squirrel, am continually
in motion, indeed, but it is only a cage of
three feet: my little excursions are like those of a
shopkeeper, who walks every day a mile or two
before his own door, but minds his business all the
while."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>We are told that Douglas Jerrold, when engaged in
preparing literary matter, used to walk back and forth
before his desk, talking wildly to himself, occasionally
stopping to note down his thoughts. Sometimes he
would burst forth in boisterous laughter when he
hit upon a droll idea. He was always extremely
restless, would pass out of the house into the garden
and stroll about, carelessly picking leaves from the
trees and chewing them; then suddenly hastening
back to his desk, he recorded any thoughts or sentences
which had formed themselves in his mind.
Jerrold wrote so fine a hand, forming his letters so
minutely, that his manuscript was hardly legible to
those not accustomed to it. He was very fastidious
about his writing-desk, permitting nothing upon it
except pen, ink, and paper. Like most persons who
habitually resort to stimulants, he could not be content
with a single glass of spirits or wine, but consumed
many, until he was only too often unfitted for
mental labor. Jerrold's wit was of a coarser texture
than that of Sheridan, but, unlike his, it came with
spontaneous force; it was always ready, though it
had not the polish which premeditation is able to impart.
Oftentimes his wit was severely sarcastic, but
as a rule it was only genial and mirth-provoking.</p>

<p>It was asked in Jerrold's club, on a certain occasion,
what was the best definition of dogmatism.
"There is but one," he instantly replied,&mdash;"the maturity
of puppyism." A member remarked one day
that the business of a mutual acquaintance was going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to the devil. "All right," said Jerrold; "then he's
sure to get it back again." Another member who
was not very popular with the club, hearing a certain
melody spoken of, said, "That always carries me
away when I hear it." "Cannot some one whistle it?"
asked Jerrold. Another member, who was rather
given to boasting, said: "Very singular! I dined at
the Marchioness of So-and-so's last week, and we
actually had no fish." "Easily explained," said
Jerrold; "no doubt they had eaten it all upstairs."
When Heraud, a somewhat bombastic versifier, asked
him if he had read his "Descent into Hell," Jerrold
instantly replied, "No; I had rather see it." Being
asked what was the idea of Harriet Martineau's
rather atheistical book, he answered that it was plain
enough,&mdash;"There is no God, and Harriet is his
Prophet." This is even better than the remark of
another wit who, when asked what was the outcome
of a meeting before which three of the ablest and
most dogmatic Positivists in England made speeches,
replied that the result arrived at was this: that there
were three persons and no God. Jerrold could not
confine himself to any regular system of work, but
drove the quill at such times and only to such purpose
as his erratic mood indicated, jumping from one
subject to another like one crossing a brook upon
stepping-stones. This, however, was a habit by no
means peculiar to Douglas Jerrold. There are some
ludicrous stories told of him; like that of his being
pursued by a printer's boy about the town, from house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to club, from club to the theatre, and so on, and
finally of his being overtaken, getting into a corner
and writing an admirable article with pencil and
paper on the top of his hat.</p>

<p>Agassiz,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> the great Swiss naturalist, who became
an adopted and honored son of this country, was singularly
unmethodical in his habits of professional
labor. If he was suddenly seized with an interest in
some scientific inquiry, he would pursue it at once,
putting by all present work, though it might be that
he had just got fairly started in another direction.
"I always like to take advantage," he would say,
"of my productive moods." The rule that we must
finish one thing before we begin another, had no
force with him. An individual connected with the
lyceum of a neighboring city called upon Agassiz
to induce him to lecture on a certain occasion, but
was courteously informed by the scientist that he
could not comply with the request. "It will be a
great disappointment to our citizens," suggested the
caller. "I am sorry for that," replied Agassiz. "We
will cheerfully give you double the usual price," added
the agent, "if you will accommodate us." "Ah,
my dear sir," replied the scientist, with that earnest
but genial expression so natural to his manly features,
"I cannot afford to waste time in making
money."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>A very similar habit of composition or study possessed
Goldsmith, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Pope, and
some others of the poets, who not infrequently laid
by a half-constructed composition for two or three
years, then finally took up the neglected theme, finished
and published it. This unmethodical style of
doing things is but one of the many eccentricities of
genius. Scott said he never knew a man of much
ability who could be perfectly regular in his habits,
while he had known many a blockhead who could.
Southey and Coleridge were at complete antipodes
in regard to regularity of habits and punctuality:
the former did everything by rule, the latter nothing.
Charles Lamb said of Coleridge, "He left forty thousand
treatises on metaphysics and divinity, not one
of them complete." Neither Agassiz, Coleridge, nor
any of similar irregularity in work, is to be imitated
in those respects. Had it not been for Agassiz's
far-seeing and vigorous powers,&mdash;in short, for his
great genius, he could never have accomplished his
remarkable mission. The deduction which we naturally
draw is, that method is a good servant but
a bad master. If genius were to be trammelled by
system and order, it would suffocate. Perhaps Montaigne
was nearly right when he thought that individuals
ought sometimes to cross the line of fixed rules,
in order to awaken their vigor and keep them from
growing musty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Coleridge was much addicted to the habit of marginal
writing; which, though sadly wasteful on his
own part, was very enriching to those friends who
loaned him from their libraries.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Charles Lamb,
who was not inclined to spare book-borrowers as a
tribe, had no reflections to cast upon Coleridge for
this habit. The depth, weight, and originality of
his comments as hastily and carelessly penned on the
margins of books were wonderful, and if collected
and classified would form several volumes, not only
of captivating interest, but of rare critical value, as
the few which have been brought together abundantly
prove. In one volume which he returned to Lamb is
this memorandum: "I shall die soon, my dear Charles
Lamb, and then you will not be vexed that I have be-scribbled
your book. S. T. C., May 2d, 1811." "Elia"
valued these marginal notes beyond price, and said
that to lose a volume to Coleridge carried some sense
and meaning with it. These critical notes often nearly
equalled in quantity of matter the original text. In
his article upon the subject, Lamb says, "I counsel
thee, shut not thy heart nor thy library against S. T.
C." As we have already said, while this erratic expenditure
of Coleridge's rare literary taste and judgment
enriched others, it in a degree impoverished
himself; for had the same time and thought been
expended upon consecutive literary work, it would
have produced volumes of inestimable value to the
world at large, and have proved monumental to their
author.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>Byron was addicted to marginalizing; and though
he could not equal Coleridge in the profundity of his
criticisms, or impart such charming interest to them,
still he was quite original and often piquant. Burns
contented himself with trifling criticisms of approval
or disapproval pencilled in the margin of books,
especially poetical ones, which were nearly all he was
in the habit of reading.</p>

<p>Many famous authors and public men have been
extravagantly fond of the rod and line, disciples of
that patient and poetical angler, Izaak Walton.
George Herbert, the English poet; Henry Wotton,
diplomatist and author; Dr. Paley, Archdeacon of
Carlisle; John Dryden, poet and dramatist; Sydney
Smith, the witty divine; Sir Humphry Davy, the
eminent chemist,&mdash;all were devoted anglers.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> This
brief list might be largely increased. Bulwer-Lytton
says: "Though no participator in the joys of more
vehement sport, I have a pleasure that I cannot reconcile
to my abstract notions of the tenderness due to
dumb creatures, in the tranquil cruelty of angling. I
can only palliate the wanton destructiveness of my
amusement by trying to assure myself that my pleasure
does not spring from the success of the treachery
I practise towards a poor little fish, but rather from
that innocent revelry in the luxuriance of summer
life which only anglers enjoy to the utmost." Walton
puts himself on record in these words: "We may say
of angling, as Dr. Boteler said of strawberries:
'Doubtless God could have made a better berry, but
doubtless God never did;' and so, if I might be judge,
God never did make a more calm, quiet, innocent
recreation than angling." Sydney Smith declared it
to be an occupation fit for a bishop, and that it need
in no way interfere with sermon-making.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<p>Perhaps the best thing said or done in angling is
an unpublished anecdote of the great preacher to the
seamen,&mdash;the late Father Taylor, of Boston. He was
once lured to try his hand at the rod, and soon
brought up a very little fish that had been tempted
by his bait. He took the small creature carefully
from the hook, gazed at it a moment, and then cast it
back into the water, with this advice: "My little
friend, go and tell your mother that you have seen a
ghost!"</p>

<p>Dr. Parr, the profound English scholar, was a most
inveterate smoker; so was Charles Lamb,<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> who one
day said to his doctor, "I have acquired this habit
by toiling over it, as some men toil after virtue."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>Robert Hall, the popular English divine, was very
much addicted to tobacco and other stimulants. A
friend who found him in his study blowing forth
clouds of smoke from his lips, said, "There you
are, at your old idol!" "Yes," replied the divine,
"burning it." Napoleon could never abide smoking
tobacco; yet observing how much other men seemed
to enjoy it, he tried to acquire the habit, but finally
gave it up in disgust. He, however, took snuff to
excess. Sir Walter Scott was very fond of smoking.
Thackeray, like Burns, loved to get away by himself
and enjoy the flavor of a rank tobacco-pipe. Carlyle,
like Tennyson, did not care for a cigar, but kept a pipe
in his mouth most of his waking hours. Bulwer-Lytton
was a ceaseless smoker; and there are few if
any notable Germans who have not been addicted to
the same indulgence. The nicotine produced from
tobacco is one of the most deadly of all poisons, as
has been proven by some startling experiments in the
Paris hospitals.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Thackeray said there was good
eating in Scott's novels. Extending the remark, it
might be added that there was good drinking in those
of Dickens, and good smoking in those of Thackeray.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>Dean Swift relieved his sombre moods by harnessing
his servants with cords and driving them, school-boy
fashion, up and down the stairs and through the
garden of the deanery of St. Patrick's Cathedral,
Dublin. Dickens was controlled by a nervous activity
which made him crave physical exercise of some
sort, and he daily found relief in an eight or ten mile
walk. Thackeray once told the author of these pages
that he preferred to take his exercise driving upon very
easy roads. When Dickens was in this country he
was frequently accompanied in his long walks by the
late James T. Fields, who was ever ready to sacrifice
himself to the pleasure of others. Mr. Fields was
not partial to extreme pedestrian exercise, and the author
of the "Pickwick Papers" tested his good-nature
to the verge of exhaustion in this respect. Dumas,
when not otherwise engaged, was accustomed to go
down into his kitchen, and, deposing the servants,
cook his own dinner; and an excellent cook he must
have been, if one half the stories rife about him be
true. Besides, did he not write an original cook-book,
which still stands for good authority in the cafés of
the boulevards?</p>

<p>Dr. Warton, the English critic and author, as represented
by contemporary authority, was noted for a
love of vulgar society, which he daily sought in low
tap-rooms and gin-shops, where he joked away the
evening hours. Turner the painter had similar
tastes and habits, though he was of a reserved and
unsociable character, and noted for his parsimony.
Shelley, Goldsmith, and Macaulay delighted in the
company of young children. "They are so near to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
God," said Shelley. "Intercourse with them freshens
and rejuvenates one's soul," wrote Macaulay. "I love
these little people; and it is not a small thing when
they, who are so fresh from God, love us," said
Dickens. Children always had a most tender and humanizing
effect upon Douglas Jerrold, no matter what
was his mood. He writes: "A creature undefiled by
the taint of the world, unvexed by its injustice, unwearied
by its hollow pleasures; a being fresh from
the source of light, with something of its universal
lustre in it. If childhood be this, how holy the duty
to see that in its onward growth it shall be no other!"</p>

<p>History tells us that Henry of Navarre, who was
every inch a king, was often seen upon his palace
floor with two of his children upon his back, playing
elephant and rider. What a peep into the king's heart
we get by this little picture of his domestic life!
Where was all the monarch's pride of State, his
kingly dignity? "How hard it is to hide the sparks
of nature!" It is related of Epictetus that he would
steal away from his philosophical associates to pass
an hour romping with a group of children,&mdash;"to
prattle, to creep, and to play with them." Charles
Robert Maturin, the poet, author of the tragedy of
"Bertram," and other successful dramas, could not
endure to have children near him during his hours of
literary composition. At such times he was particularly
sensitive, and pasted a wafer on his forehead as
a token to the members of his family that he was
not to be interrupted. He said if he lost the thread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of his ideas even for a moment, they were gone from
him altogether. Sir Walter Scott, on the contrary,
was ever ready to lay down his pen at any moment,
to exchange pleasant words with child or adult, friend
or stranger; and it was notorious that children could
always interrupt him with impunity. He declared
that their childish accents made his heart dance with
glee. He could not check their confidence and simplicity,
though pressed upon him when his thoughts
were soaring in poetic flights or describing vivid
scenes of warfare and carnage. Scott preserved considerable
system, nevertheless, in his composition and
labor. He lay awake, he tells us, for a brief period
in the quiet of the early morning, and arranged
carefully in his mind the work of the coming day.
He laid out systematically the subject upon which
he was writing, and resolved in what manner he
would treat it. Thus it was that he could lay down
his pen at any moment without deranging the purpose
of the work. He had one axiom to which he
tenaciously adhered, and was often heard to repeat
it to his dependants and friends: "Do whatever is
to be done, at once; take the hours of reflection or
recreation after business, and never before it."</p>

<p>Schiller said that children made him half glad and
half sorry,&mdash;always inclined to moralize. "Happy
child," he exclaims, "the cradle is still to thee a
vast space: become a man, and the boundless world
will be too small for thee." Goethe was ever watchful,
loving, and tender with the young. "Children,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
he says, "like dogs, have so sharp and fine a scent,
that they detect and hunt out everything." He
thought their innocent delusions should be held
sacred. Elihu Burritt, the "Learned Blacksmith,"
says that he once congratulated an humble farmer
upon having a fine group of sons. "Yes, they are
good boys," was the father's answer. "I talk to
them often, but I do not beat my children,&mdash;the
world will beat them by and by, if they live." A fine
thought, rudely expressed.</p>

<p>Shelley's interest in children was connected with
his half belief in the Platonic doctrine of pre-existence.
As he was passing over one of the great London
bridges, meditating on the mystery, he saw a
poor working-woman with a child a few months old
in her arms. Here was an opportunity to bring the
theory to a decisive test: and in his impulsive way
he took the infant from its astonished mother, and
in his shrill voice began to ask it questions as to the
world from which it had so recently come. The
child screamed, the indignant parent called for the
police to rescue her baby from the philosophical kidnapper;
and as Shelley reluctantly delivered the infant
to its mother's arms, he muttered, as he passed
on, "How strange it is that these little creatures
should be so provokingly reticent!" Shelley was a
child himself in many respects; in illustration of
which the reader has only to recall the poet's singular
amusement of sailing paper boats whenever
he found himself conveniently near a pond. So long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
as the paper which he chanced to have about him
lasted, he remained riveted to the spot. First he
would use the cover of letters, next letters of little
value; but he could not resist the temptation, finally,
of employing for the purpose the letters of his most
valued correspondents. He always carried a book in
his pocket, but the fly-leaves were all consumed in
forming these paper boats and setting them adrift
to constitute a miniature fleet. Once he found himself
on the banks of the Serpentine River without
paper of any sort except a ten-pound note. He refrained
for a while; but presently it was rapidly
twisted into a boat by his skilful fingers, and devoted
to his boat-sailing purpose without further
delay. Its progress being watched, it was finally
picked up on the opposite shore of the river and returned
to the owner for more legitimate use.</p>

<p>Charles Lamb in his quaint way says: "I know that
sweet children are the sweetest things in nature, not
even excepting the delicate creatures which bear them;
but the prettier the kind of a thing is, the more desirable
it is that it should be pretty of its kind. One
daisy differs not much from another in glory; but a
violet should look and smell the daintiest."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Good and substantial food is quite as necessary to
authors and public men, as to those who gain their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>livelihood by laborious physical employment. Authors
are, however, as a rule, rather inclined to free
indulgence at table. There is as much intemperance
in eating as in drinking. Tom Moore, who was
the best diner-out of his day, said, by way of excusing
this habit, "In grief, I have always found
eating a wonderful relief." N. P. Willis was quite
a gourmand. "There are," he once wrote, "so few
invalids untemptable by those deadly domestic enemies,
sweetmeats, pastry, and gravies, that the usual
civilities at a meal are very like being politely assisted
to the grave." It is certainly better to punish
our appetites than to be punished by them. Dickens
and Thackeray were both inclined to free indulgence
at the table, the former being struck with death at a
public banquet. Dean Swift often gave better advice
than he was himself inclined to follow. He says:
"Temperance," meaning both in eating and drinking,
"is a necessary virtue to great men, since it is the
parent of the mind, which philosophy allows to be
one of the greatest felicities in life." Macready, the
famous English tragedian, would not touch food of
any kind for some hours before making one of his
grand dramatic efforts, but drank freely of strong
tea before appearing in public,&mdash;a subtle stimulant
in which the late Rufus Choate freely indulged, particularly
before addressing a jury.</p>

<p>Abstinence in diet was a special virtue with Milton.
Shelley utterly despised the pleasures of the table.
Walter Scott was an abstemious eater. Pope was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
great epicure, and so was the poet Gay. Speaking of
appetite, Coleridge tells us of a man he once saw at
a dinner-table, who struck him as remarkable for his
dignity and wise face. The awful charm of his manner
was not broken until the muffins appeared, and
then the wise one exclaimed, "Them's the jockeys
for me!" Dignity is sometimes very rudely unmasked,
and an imposing air is nearly always the
cloak of a fool. Newton lived on the simplest food.
"If Aristotle could diet on acorns," he said, "so can
I;" and before sitting down to study he exercised
freely and abstained from food. Dr. George Fordyce,
the eminent Scotch physician, ate but one meal a
day, saying that if one meal in twenty-four hours was
enough for a lion, it was sufficient for a man; but in
order not to be like the lion, he drank a bottle of
port, half a pint of brandy, and a pitcher of ale with
his one meal. Lamartine used to pass one day in ten
fasting, as he said, to clear both stomach and brain.
Aristo, the stoic philosopher, used to fast for days
on acorns. Thomas Byron, a well-known author,
never ate flesh of any sort. Dryden's favorite dish
was a chine of bacon. Charles Lamb was enamoured
of roast pig. He said, "You can no more improve
sucking pig than you can refine a violet!" Keats
was a very fastidious eater, but was fond of the table,
especially where there was good wine,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and yet he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>not addicted to its intemperate use. Dr. Johnson
was greedy over boiled mutton; and Dr. Rhondelet,
the famous writer on fishes, was so fond of figs that
he died from having at one time eaten immoderately
of them. Barrow, one of the greatest of English theologians
and mathematicians, is said to have died of
a surfeit of pears,&mdash;a fruit of which he was extravagantly
fond.</p>

<p>Gastronomic appetite and reason have been compared
to two buckets in a well; when one is at the top
the other is at the bottom. Byron nearly starved
himself to prevent growing gross and uninteresting in
physical aspect. Addison was addicted to port and
claret, and was accustomed, as already spoken of,
while meditating a moral or political essay, to pace
up and down the long gallery of Holland House.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
When a humorous suggestion occurred to his fertile
fancy, he solaced himself with claret; or fortified himself
with a glass of port when a moral sentiment
required to be enforced by an impressive close to a
beautifully constructed sentence.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> This was after
his frigid marriage to the Dowager Countess of Warwick.
On his death-bed he is reported to have said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>to her graceless son, "See how a Christian can die!"
Probably the profligate youth, spying his father-in-law
as he walked in the gallery, might have irreverently
remarked: "See how a Christian can drink!" But
the truth is that Addison, judged by the habits of
his time, should be considered a moderate drinker.
Poe's nerves were so shattered that a slight amount
of wine would intoxicate him into a frenzy of dissipation;
the same amount swallowed by a regular toper
would hardly disturb his brain at all. While Pitt
was quite a young man, he was so weakly that his
physician ordered him to drink freely of port wine,
and he thus contracted the habit of depending upon
stimulants, and could not do without them. Lord
Greville tells us he has seen him swallow a bottle of
port wine by tumblerfuls before going to the House.
This, together with the habit of late suppers, helped
materially to shorten his life.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Goldsmith had a queer fancy for sassafras tea, from
which he imagined he derived an excellent tonic effect.
Such a relish had certainly one element to recommend
it,&mdash;and that was its harmlessness. Dr. Shaw, the
English naturalist, nearly killed himself by drinking
green tea to excess. Haydn partook immoderately of
strong coffee, and kept it brewing by his side while he
composed. Burns lived on whiskey for weeks together,
supplemented by tobacco, which caused Byron to say
that he was "a strange compound of dirt and deity."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p><p>Aristippus of old lived up to his own motto; namely,
"Good cheer is no hindrance to a good life." Few
men reason about their appetites, but they give way to
them until disease reminds them they are made of
mortal stuff. Even Plutarch used to indulge at times
in riotous living, saying, "You cannot reason with
the belly; it has no ears." Addison has pithily recorded
his own ideas of this matter. "When I behold
a fashionable table set out in all its magnificence," he
says, "I fancy that I see gouts and dropsies, fevers and
lethargies, with other innumerable distempers, lying
in ambuscade among the dishes. Nature delights in
the most plain and simple diet. Every animal but
man keeps to one dish. Herbs are the food of this
species, fish of that, and flesh of a third. Man falls
upon everything that comes in his way; not the smallest
fruit or excrescence of the earth, scarce a berry
or a mushroom, can escape him." It is among the
easiest of all things to outsit both our health and our
pleasure at the table. "The pleasures of the palate,"
said shrewd old Seneca, "deal with us like Egyptian
thieves, who strangle those whom they embrace."</p>

<p>Thackeray said towards the close of his life, that
his physicians warned him habitually not to do what
he habitually did. "They tell me that I should not
drink wine, and somehow I drink wine; that I should
not eat this or that, and, guided by my appetite for
this or that, I disregard the warning."</p>

<p>Eminent men are not unlike the rest of humanity
in a desire for some sort of recreation, and each one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
finds it after his own natural bent or fancy. Literature
is capable of affording the most rational and
lasting enjoyment to cultured minds, but physical
exercise has also its reasonable demands. The late
Victor Emmanuel found recreation only in hunting,
having a number of lodges devoted to this purpose in
different parts of Italy. McMahon, late President of
France, was also an ardent sportsman. William the
Conqueror passed all his leisure in the hunting-field;
and President Cleveland hastens with rod and gun to
pass his vacation in the Adirondack region. Henry V.
occupied a whole day at a time upon his one game,&mdash;tennis.
Cardinal Mazarin, while virtual ruler of
France, used to shut himself up in his library and pass
an hour daily in jumping over the chairs. Louis XVI.
had a passion for constructing intricate locks and
keys, many curious specimens of which are still extant
in the Cluny Museum. Charles II. in his leisure
hours enjoyed practical chemistry. John Milton wiled
away the long hours of his blindness, when not engaged
in composing and dictating, by playing upon a
cabinet organ; and Chief Justice Saunders was given
to the same recreation. The Duke of Burgundy had a
singular fancy for constructing mechanical traps and
surprises in his house and grounds, so that visitors
were liable to encounter practical jokes at every turn.</p>

<p>We might cover pages in enumerating the resorts
of notable people in their instinctive search after
necessary recreation from sterner duties. Man must
be doing something in order to be happy; action being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
quite as necessary to the health of body and brain as
thought. Schiller declared that he found the greatest
happiness of life to consist in the regular discharge
of some mechanical duty. "Cheerfulness," says the
shrewd and practical Dr. Horne, is "the daughter of
employment; and I have known a man come home
from a funeral in high spirits, merely because he had
the management of it." It is in our unoccupied moments
that discontent creeps into the mind; busy
people have no time to be very miserable. Amusements
are not without a double purpose, and it is
only a mistaken zeal which argues against those that
are innocent. "Let the world," says that wise old
philosopher Robert Burton, "have their May-games,
wakes, whatsunales, their dancings and concerts;
their puppet-shows, hobby horses, tabors, bagpipes,
balls, barley-breaks, and whatever sports and recreations
please them best, provided they be followed with
discretion."</p>

<p>Sir George Cornewall Lewis, a scholar as well as a
statesman, found delight in a variety of intellectual
work. He shirked as well as he could all invitations
to parties, balls, and dinners, and once despairingly
exclaimed, when he was called from his studies to
enter into some form of amusement, "that life was
tolerable were it not for its pleasures."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p class="large center p4">CHAPTER V.</p>


<p>Leonardo da Vinci, the inspired painter of the
"Last Supper" upon the walls of the time-worn
Milan convent,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> is said to have had a strange inclination
for dirt. One biographer tells us he grovelled
in it. Da Vinci was a great engineer and scientist,
as well as artist. The face of Judas in the group
seated at the table carries with it a legend. The
artist entertained a bitter enmity towards a priest of
the Cathedral who had worked him some vital injury,
either real or imaginary. His revenge was clear to
him; his enemy's hated features were impressed
upon his mind, and so, a little modified to suit the
supposed treacherous character of the disciple, were
made to constitute those of Judas at the moment
when he contemplates the betrayal of his Master.
The likeness was too plain not to be recognized by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>those who knew of the ill feeling existing between
the artist and priest. The result was that the latter
was virtually banished from the city, as he asked to
be, and was transferred to Rome.</p>

<p>Raphael thought he could paint best under the inspiration
of wine, and therefore used it freely. Some
modern critics pretend to discover the vinous influence
in certain exaggerations of style peculiar to his best
pictures. Notwithstanding the number and grandeur
of the works which he left behind him, he died prematurely
at the age of thirty-seven. A book might easily
be written upon the peculiarities and habits of artists;
but we continue our desultory gossip.</p>

<p>How often we see the lives and fortunes of individuals
contingent upon seeming chance! Cromwell
and Hampden, who were cousins, both took passage
in a vessel that lay in the Thames, bound for this
country, in 1637. They were actually on board, when
an order of council prohibited the vessel from sailing.
We recall two other instances of a similar character
in the career of Goethe and Robert Burns, each of
whom was once on the eve of sailing for America
to seek a foreign home. Locke was banished from
England by force of public opinion, in company with
his friend Lord Ashley, and wrote his well-known
"Essay on the Human Understanding"<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> in a Dutch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>garret. He finally lived down all detraction, and
was himself a practical example of that self-teaching
which he so strongly advocates in his writings.
He possessed a wonderful memory; so also did
Thomas Fuller, who could repeat five hundred unconnected
words after twice hearing them. Coleridge
esteemed Fuller, not only for his wit, originality,
and liberality, but as being the most sensible great
man of an age that boasted a galaxy of great
men.</p>

<p>Jeremy Taylor, whose birth is shrouded in mystery,
though he is said to be the son of a barber, was a singular
compound, in character, of simplicity and erudition.
He was always a child among children, and it is
said that a child could at any time attract his attention.
He encountered many of the sterner vicissitudes
of life, being more than once cast into prison. In the
civil war he was a decided adherent of Charles I.,
and some have supposed him to have been a natural
son of that monarch. Emerson calls him the Shakespeare
of divines. Gibbon, the distinguished historian,
composed while walking back and forth in his
room, completely arranging his ideas in his brain
before taking his pen in hand, which in a degree
accounts for the correctness of his manuscript.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Mon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>taigne
and Châteaubriand,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> when disposed to composition,
sought the open fields and unfrequented paths,
where, somewhat like Gibbon, they arranged their
matter with great precision before sitting down to
write. Bacon always wrote in a small room, because,
as he believed, it enabled him to concentrate his
thoughts. Franklin wrote and studied with a plate of
bread and cheese by his side to repair mental waste,
as he said, and also to economize time. Is there not
a ceaseless interest hanging over the domestic and
professional habits of these famous men of the past?</p>

<p>Congreve, to whom Pope dedicated his Iliad and
Dryden submitted his poems for criticism before
giving them to the public, was extremely popular,
witty, and original as a dramatist. Congreve was a
slow writer, and was the father, as it were, of that
style of writing which died with Sheridan. He wrote
only a few dramas, but those were incomparable for
the brilliancy of the dialogue; yet the brilliancy was
obtained by the hardest intellectual <i>work</i>. According
to Macaulay, no English author except Byron had at
so early an age stood so high in the estimation of his
contemporaries. But the licentiousness and general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>immorality of the works of Congreve are without
excuse.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> He had not even the paltry plea of necessity,
which might lead him to pander to a vitiated
taste in seeking a market for his wares, as was
evidently the case with Fielding. He was very desirous
to pass for a man of fashion, and affectedly
sneered at his own literary productions, declaring
them to be produced simply to while away his idle
hours. Vanity seems to have completely overshadowed
any spirit of ambition which may have originally
inspired him.  Flattery and royal patronage
were the ruin of Congreve so far as his after fame
is concerned. Had he known the wholesome spur of
necessity, his grand powers would have shone with
surpassing lustre. He had the genius, but not the
incentive, wherewith to make a great name. Pope is
said, on a certain occasion, to have hinted as much
to Congreve, whom he really reverenced for his ability,
and to have incurred his partial enmity thereby.
"Oh that men's ears should be to counsel deaf," says
Shakespeare, "but not to flattery." The broad inconsistency
of Congreve's dramas is the fact that all his
characters are equally endowed with wit, culture, and
genius. Collier, in his review of the profaneness of the
English stage, administered to Congreve a merited
castigation, to which the dramatist attempted to reply,
but without success.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p>The remarkable vicissitudes which have waited upon
the career of men of genius, and especially of authors,
are very noticeable. The earliest authentic history
shows us the same fatality besetting the paths of
such characters as has pursued them to the present
day. The student of the past will recall as examples
Seneca and his friend Lucan, who were honored and
famous in the days of Nero. Both of these renowned
authors, when condemned to death, lanced their veins
and sung a dying requiem while the tide of their lives
ebbed slowly away. So Socrates drank of the fatal
hemlock, like Sappho and Lucretius, voluntarily seeking
death. "That which is a necessity to him that
struggles, is little more than a choice to him who is
willing," says Seneca. Sophocles, the Greek tragic poet
and rival of Æschylus, was brought to trial by his own
children as a lunatic. He composed more than a hundred
tragedies, of which seven are still extant. He
also excelled as a musician. Plautus, poet and dramatist,
was at one time a baker's assistant, earning his
bread by grinding corn in a hand-mill. Tasso, Italy's
favorite epic poet, became broken-hearted from unrequited
love, and was confined in a mad-house for years,
and, illustrative of the mutability of fortune, was afterwards
brought to Rome to be crowned, like Petrarch,
with laurels, but died before the day of coronation.
Euripides, one of the three tragic poets of Greece,
was torn to pieces by dogs; and Hesiod, a still more
ancient poet, fell by the assassin's dagger. In later
times there looms up the name of Galileo, the dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>coverer
and natural philosopher, imprisoned by the
Inquisition for teaching men that the world moved.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
"Poor Galileo," said a modern wit, "was too honest;
he should have treated these inquisitors to a champagne
supper, and they would have risen from it with
the conviction that the world surely <i>did</i> turn round."
Galileo's greatest affliction, however, was that of
becoming totally blind. Milton, who visited him in
prison, tells us he was poor and old. In a letter
which he dictated to a correspondent, Galileo says:
"Alas! your dear friend has become irreparably blind.
The heavens, the earth, this universe, which by wonderful
observation I have enlarged a thousand times
past the belief of former ages, are henceforth shrunk
into the narrow space which I myself occupy." Handel
also passed the last of his life in the gloom of
blindness; and Beethoven was afflicted with incurable
deafness, which nearly drove him to suicide.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It was
perhaps the most trying misfortune possible to one
with his special endowments. Have not these historic
characters tested the familiar axiom that calamity is
man's true touchstone?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p><p>Dante, the greatest poet between the Augustan and
Elizabethan ages, was expatriated and exiled from
wife and children, becoming a poverty-stricken wanderer.
Thus broken in heart and fortune he was
hurried by persecution to his grave. Spenser, who
endowed English verse with the soul of harmony
while eking out a life of misery, finally died in abject
poverty. Milton sold "Paradise Lost"<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> for ten
pounds. "When Milton composed that grand poem,"
says Carlyle, "he was not only poor but impoverished;
he was in darkness, and with dangers compassed
round, he sang his immortal song, and found fit audience,
though few." At one time Milton borrowed
fifty pounds of Jonathan Hartop, of Aldborough, who
lived to the remarkable age of one hundred and thirty-eight
years, dying in 1791. He returned the loan at
the time agreed upon, but Mr. Hartop, knowing his
straitened circumstances, refused to take the money;
the pride of the poet, however, was equal to his genius,
and he sent the money back a second time with an
angry letter, which was found years afterwards among
the papers of the remarkable old man. Corneille,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>the French dramatist; Vaugelas, a noted author of
the same nationality; Crabbe, the English poet; Chatterton,
the precocious and versatile genius; Holzmann,
the profound Oriental scholar; Cervantes;
Camoens,<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> the pride of Portugal; and Erasmus, the
Dutch scholar, who rose to the leadership of the literature
of his day,&mdash;all lived more or less continuously
on the verge of starvation. Camoens had a black servant
who had grown old with him. This man, a native
of Java, is said to have saved his master's life in
the shipwreck whereby he lost all his fortune except
his poems. In after years, when Camoens became
so much reduced as to be able no longer to support
his servant, the faithful retainer begged in the streets
of Lisbon for bread to sustain the one great poet of
Portugal. Le Sage, author of "Gil Blas," was endowed
with exquisite literary taste, but the victim of
extreme poverty. De Quincey, the eminent English
author, tells us that he passed much time in London
in the most abject want, living upon precarious charity.
Nowhere else can so vivid a picture of misused genius
be found as in the "Confessions of an English Opium-Eater."
De Quincey was noted for his rare conversational
powers, supplemented by a vast and varied
stock of information. He was finally successful in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>business point of view, and was possessed of a noble
generosity, as he relieved at a critical moment the
necessities of Coleridge at a cost of five hundred
pounds. This was at a comparatively early period of
De Quincey's life. Afterwards he was himself often
in want of a tenth part of the sum. He was a voluminous
writer, though not always publishing under his
own name; his collection of works as issued in this
country, edited by J. T. Fields, forms some twenty volumes.
Let us not forget to mention Sydenham, the
English scholar who gave us, among other profound
works, the best version of Plato, and who breathed
his last in a London sponging-house. "Genius,"
says Whipple, "may almost be defined as the faculty
of acquiring poverty."</p>

<p>Some writers have contended, and not without
reason, that such adversity was often providential;
that without the spur of necessity genius would rarely
accomplish its best, and that distress has often elicited
talents which would otherwise have remained dormant.
In speaking of Burns, Carlyle says: "We question
whether for his culture as a poet, poverty and much
suffering were not absolutely advantageous. Great
men in looking back over their lives have testified to
that effect. 'I would not for much,' says Jean Paul,
'that I had been born rich.' And yet Jean Paul's
birth was poor enough, for in another place he adds:
'The prisoner's allowance is bread and water, and I
have often only the latter.' But the gold that is refined
in the hottest furnace comes out the purest; or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
as he has himself expressed it, 'the canary-bird sings
sweetest the longer it has been trained in a darkened
cage.'" Horace emphatically declares, that adversity
has the effect of developing talents which prosperous
circumstances would not have elicited. The hardships
endured by many historic persons crowd upon the
mind in this connection. We remember John Bunyan
in Bedford jail,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> writing that immortal work, "Pilgrim's
Progress;" Ben Jonson,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> the comrade of Shakespeare;
John Seldon, the profound scholar and author; and
Jeremy Taylor, whose "Holy Living and Dying" is
only second to "Pilgrim's Progress,"&mdash;all of whom
endured the suffering of imprisonment.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Nor must
we forget Sir Walter Raleigh, who during his thirteen
years of prison-life produced his incomparable "History
of the World."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Lydiat, the subtle scholar to
whom Dr. Johnson refers, wrote his "Annotations on
the Parian Chronicles," while confined for debt in the
King's Bench; and Wicquefort's curious work on Ambassadors
is dated from the prison to which he was
condemned for life. Voltaire wrote his "Henriad"
while confined in the Bastile; De Foe produced his
best works within the walls of Newgate; and Cervantes
gave the world "Don Quixote" from a prison.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p><p>Some of the sweetest love-lyrics extant were written
by Charles, Duke of Orleans, during his captivity of
twenty-five years. Baron Trenck wrote his wonderful
book of personal experience during a ten years' captivity
in a subterranean dungeon at Magdeburg,&mdash;a
book which has been translated into every modern
language. He was released from prison, but died by
the guillotine at Paris in 1794. Silvio Pellico, the
Italian poet and dramatist, who wrote the well-known
story of his prison life, was ten years confined in the
fortress of Spielberg, in Moravia. Ponce de Leon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>among the foremost of Spanish poets, as well as the
poet Alonzo de Ereilla, were victims of long and severe
incarceration because they dared to translate
the Biblical Songs of Solomon into Spanish. James
Howell, the English author, wrote his "Familiar Letters"
in the Fleet Prison. So popular were they, that
he had the pleasure of seeing ten editions of them
published in rapid succession; this was about the
year 1646. William Penn and Roger Williams, both
founders of States in this country, suffered imprisonment.
The former wrote his well-known "No Cross,
No Crown" in the Tower of London. Oakley, the
great Oriental scholar, whose remarkable Asiatic researches
have rendered his name famous, wrote his
work on the Saracens in jail. Cobbett, the political
satirist, was no stranger to the inside of a prison;
and we all remember Cooper, the English chartist,
who made himself famous by his "Prison Rhymes,"
written behind the frowning bars. Montgomery suffered
the same chilling influences for daring to make
a public plea for freedom of speech. Theodore Hook,
the novelist, delightful miscellaneous writer, and unrivalled
wit, was for a long period imprisoned.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>Richard Lovelace, the English poet, was a gallant
soldier who spilled his blood for his king in the
civil war and impoverished himself in the same
cause, was imprisoned for political reasons, and died
poor and neglected at the age of forty. He wrote to
"Lucasta,"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> when going to the wars, that fine and
often-quoted couplet:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I could not love thee, dear, so much,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Loved I not honor more."</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Lucasta (<i>Lux casta</i>, "pure light"), to whom his verses
were dedicated, was Lady Sacheverell, whom he devotedly
loved, but who married another after having
been deceived by the false report that Lovelace had
been killed. He was liberated from prison under
Cromwell, but lived a wretched life thereafter. Leigh
Hunt, the most genial of essayists, was imprisoned
for two years, when he was visited by Lamb, Byron,
and Moore. His offence was a libel on the Prince
Regent, afterwards George the Fourth. Madame
Guyon wrote the most of her beautiful poems&mdash;so
greatly admired by Cowper&mdash;while a captive for four
years in the Bastile. The great public library of
Paris contains forty octavo volumes of her writings.
Why does not some popular author give us a book
upon this theme, and entitle it "Behind the Prison
Bars"? The suggestion is freely offered, and is perhaps
worth considering. Disraeli tells us: "The
gate of the prison has sometimes been the porch of
fame."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<p>The reference to Lovelace reminds us that sometimes
the female favorites of poets are selected from
rather questionable positions, and certainly with very
questionable taste. Prior poured out his admiration
in verses addressed to Chloe, a fat barmaid; and
Bousard addressed poems to Cassandra, who followed
the same refining occupation. Colletet, a French
bard, addressed his lines to his servant-girl, whom
he afterwards married. No doubt that oftenest the
poet's mistress has no actual existence, but, like the
sculptor's ideal, is the combined result drawn from
several choice models.</p>

<p>Gilbert Wakefield, the erudite scholar, theologian,
and author, suffered two years' imprisonment for publishing
his "Enquiry into the Expediency of Public
and Social Worship." "The sentence passed upon
him was most infamous," says Rogers, who, in company
with his sister, visited the prisoner in Dorchester
jail. While incarcerated here, Wakefield wrote his
"Noctes Carcerariæ" ("Prison Nights"). Matthew
Prior, the poet, diplomatist, courtier, and versatile
author, was the son of a joiner, though it is not known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
exactly where he was born. Chancing to interest
the Earl of Dorset, he was educated at the cost of
that liberal nobleman. He<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> was one of those, as
Dr. Johnson said, "that have burst out from an
obscure original to great eminence." Thackeray says
of him, "He loved, he drank, he sang; and he was
certainly deemed one of the brightest lights of Queen
Anne's reign." His contempt for pedigree was very
natural, and was wittily expressed in the epitaph
which he wrote for himself:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Nobles and heralds, by your leave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here lies what once was Matthew Prior;</span><br />
The son of Adam and of Eve:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can Bourbon or Nassau claim higher?"</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Schumann, the German musical composer, author
of "Paradise and the Peri," in a fit of mental depression
threw himself into the Rhine, but was rescued.
Goethe, Alfieri, Raphael, and George Sand all struggled
against a nearly fatal temptation to end their
earthly careers. The last named declared that at
the sight of a body of water or a precipice she could
hardly restrain herself from committing suicide!
"Genius bears within itself a principle of destruction,
of death, and of madness," says Lamartine. De
Quincey, who was never quite sane, was given to queer
habits in connection with his literary work. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>wont to keep his manuscripts stored in his bath-tub,
and carried his money in his hat.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Cowper, after a
fruitless attempt to hang himself, became a religious
monomaniac, "hovering in the twilight of reason and
the dawn of insanity."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Moore, the gay, vivacious,
witty, diner-out, sank finally into childish imbecility.
John Clare, the English peasant poet, was born in
poverty; his early productions accidentally attracted
attention and gained him patrons, but after a brief,
irregular, unhappy career he died in an insane asylum.
So also died Charles Fenno Hoffman, our own popular
poet, editor, and novelist, who wrote "Sparkling
and Bright." Cruden, the industrious author and
compiler of the Biblical Concordance, suffered from
long fits of insanity; and so did Jeremy Bentham,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
though he lived to extreme old age, and died so late
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>as 1832. Congreve said it was the prerogative of
great souls to be wretched; and Jean Paul, that great
souls attract sorrows as lofty mountains do storms.
Lenau, the Hungarian lyric poet, died in a mad-house;
in the height of his fame he refused, when invited, to
visit an asylum, saying, "I shall be there soon enough
as it is." It would seem but charitable to attribute
fits of insanity to Carlyle, who pronounced most of
his contemporaries "fools and lunatics." His wife
confessed that she felt as if she were keeping a mad-house.
Vaugelas died in such poverty that he bequeathed
his body to the surgeons at Paris for a given
sum with which to pay his last board-bill. In his will
he wrote: "As there may still remain creditors unpaid
after all that I have shall be disposed of, it is my
last wish that my body should be sold to the surgeons
to the best advantage, and that the purchase-money
should go to discharge those debts which I owe to
society, so that if I could not while living, at least
when dead I may be useful." Vaugelas was called
the owl, because he ventured forth only at night,
through fear of his creditors.</p>

<p>Next to the "Newgate Calendar," it has been said,
the biography of authors is the most sickening chapter
in the history of man. "Woe be to the youthful
poet who sets out upon his pilgrimage to the
temple of fame with nothing but hope for his viaticum!"
wrote Southey, in 1813, to a young man
who had consulted him. "There is the Slough of
Despond, and the Hill of Difficulty, and the Valley of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the Shadow of Death upon the way." Coleridge's
exhortation to youthful literati may be summed up in
one sentence: "Never pursue literature as a trade."
Béranger's advice was by no means to be despised.
He spoke as one having authority, and he certainly
had experience.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> "Write if you will," he says,
"versify if you must, sing away if the singing mood
is an imperative mood, but on no account give up
your other occupation; let your authorship be a pastime,
not a trade; let it be your avocation, not your
vocation." Even the successful Washington Irving
speaks of "the seductive but treacherous paths of
literature." He adds: "There is no life more precarious
in its profits and more fallacious in its enjoyments
than that of an author." But these lines were
addressed to his nephew, and must be taken <i>cum grano
salis</i>. He had genius, his nephew had not; he never
could have acquired so much money had he, like
Halleck, become a clerk,&mdash;even the clerk of Mr. Astor.
The truth is, most writers have failed in authorship
because they have not had talent enough to write books
that an intelligent public would buy and read, and
because their vagabond habits deterred them from
being employed by merchants and tradesmen as salesmen
and clerks. Real genius now obtains a remuner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>ation
always higher than that of clerks and tradesmen.
It is mediocre writers who mourn in our days; but
they should never have taken as a profession a role
they were incompetent to fill. They are like doctors
who cannot obtain patients, and lawyers who cannot
attract clients.</p>

<p>But we were considering the past, not the present.
Robert Heron, author, scholar, teacher, who wrote
much that will live in literature, died in hopeless
poverty. His "History of Scotland" and his "Universal
Geography" are still among our best books of
reference. He says of himself in a paper written just
before he died: "The tenor of my life has been temperate,
laborious, humble, and quiet, and, to the utmost
of my power, beneficent. For these last three months
I have been brought to the very extremity of bodily
and pecuniary distress, and I shudder at the thought
of perishing in jail." Yet such was his fate; he died
in Newgate. Thomas Decker, the English author, and
collaborator with Ford and Rowley in the production
of popular dramas, died in a debtor's prison. Christopher
Smart, the personal friend of Dr. Johnson,
produced his principal poem while confined in a mad-house.
Richard Savage, the English poet, experienced
a life which reads like fiction.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The natural son of
an English earl and countess, he was abandoned by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>mother to the care of a nurse who brought him up in
ignorance of his parentage. Before he was thirty
years of age he was tried and condemned for murder;
and, though finally pardoned, he died in jail.
During a considerable portion of the time that Savage
was engaged upon his tragedy of "Sir Thomas Overbury,"
he was without lodgings and often without
meat; nor had he any other convenience for study and
composition than the open fields or the public streets.
Having formed his sentences and speeches in his
mind, he would step into a shop, ask for pen and ink,
and write down what he had composed upon such
scraps of paper as he had picked up by chance, often
from the street gutters.</p>

<p>Thomas Hood, the famous English humorist, began
at first as a clerk in a store, then became apprentice to
an engraver; but his genius soon led him to seek literary
occupation as a regular means of support. He
was endowed with an unlimited fund of wit and comic
power. His "Song of the Shirt" showed that he had
also great tenderness and pathos in his nature. He
edited various magazines and weekly papers, and published
two or three humorous books; but his career
was far from a success in any light. His life was
occupied in incessant brain-work, aggravated by ill-health
and the many uncertainties of authorship. He
finally died poor in his forty-seventh year, leaving a
dependent family.</p>

<p>William Thom was an English poet of genius, but
very humbly born. He was at first a weaver and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
afterwards a strolling pedler, often only too glad to
obtain a lodging in a country barn. The poor fellow
said, "There's much good sleeping to be had in a hayloft."
In one of these deplorable shelters his only
child, who followed him, perished from hunger and
exposure. Thom published so late as 1844 a collection
of his poems entitled, "Rhymes and Recollections
of a Hand-Weaver." The volume was well
received, and the author was given a dinner by his
London admirers. He died at the age of fifty-nine in
extreme poverty. We find two admirable poems by
him in Sargent's "British and American Poets."</p>

<p>The reader who has perused these pages thus far
will doubtless have come to the conclusion that even
talent is not developed as a rule in calm and sunshine,
but that it must encounter the tempest in some form
before the fruit can ripen. Byron, in the third canto
of "Childe Harold," thus gloomily declares the penalties
of becoming famous:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"He who ascends to mountain-tops shall find</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He who surpasses or subdues mankind</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must look down on the hate of those below.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though high <i>above</i> the sun of glory glow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And far <i>beneath</i> the earth and ocean spread,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Round</i> him are icy rocks, and loudly blow</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Contending tempests on his naked head,</span><br />
And thus reward the toils which to those summits led."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Longfellow's idea is true and forcible: "Time has
a doomsday book, in which he is continually recording
illustrious names. But as soon as a new name is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
written there, an old one disappears. Only a few
stand in illumined characters never to be effaced."</p>

<p>Thackeray's tender and beautiful thoughts upon
this subject occur to us here: "To be rich, to be
famous? do these profit a year hence, when other
names sound louder than yours, when you lie hidden
away under ground, along with the idle titles engraven
on your coffin? Only true love lives after you, follows
your memory with secret blessings, or pervades you
and intercedes for you. <i>Non omnis moriar</i>, if, dying,
I yet live in a tender heart or two; nor am lost and
hopeless, living, if a sainted departed soul still loves
and prays for me."</p>

<p class="large center p4">CHAPTER VI.</p>


<p>Our familiar gossip thus far concerning those whose
lives by universal consent, "rising above the deluge
of years," bear the impress of genius, has led us to
speak of the hardships and vicissitudes to which they
have so often been subjected. At this sad yet interesting
aspect of genius we will continue to glance,
observing, as hitherto, no chronological order, but
discussing the personalities of each character as they
are unrolled before us on the panorama of memory.</p>

<p>Handel, most original of composers, after losing his
entire fortune in a legitimate effort to further the
interests of the art he loved so well, passed the last
of his life in the gloom of blindness. His glorious
oratorios were most of them produced under the stress
of keen adversity, loss of fortune, and failing health,
quite sufficient to have discouraged any one not truly
inspired.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Mozart also labored under the ban of poverty.
He was glad to accept even the position of
chapel-master. It is well known that during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>composition of some of his masterpieces he and his
family suffered for bread. The great composer was
so absorbed in music that he was but a child in
matters of business.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Whatever may be the true
definition of genius, perseverance and application
form no inconsiderable part of it. "It is a very
great error," said Mozart, "to suppose that my art
has been easily acquired. I assure you that there
is scarcely any one that has so worked at the study
of composition as I have. You could hardly mention
any famous composer whose writings I have not diligently
and repeatedly studied throughout." A boy
came to Mozart wishing to compose something, and
inquiring the way to begin. Mozart told him to wait.
"You composed much earlier," said the youth. "But
asked nothing about it," replied the musician.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Willmott
says very truly that genius finds its own road
and carries its own lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p><p>We have seen that Goldsmith produced some of his
finest literary work under stress of circumstances.
"Oh, gods! gods!" he exclaimed to his friend Bryanton,
"here in a garret, writing for bread and expecting
to be dunned for a milk-score!" Like so many other
children of genius, he was careless, extravagant, irregular,
always in debt and difficulty, all which hurried
him to his grave. He died at the age of forty-five.
When, on his death-bed, the physician asked him if
his mind was at ease, he answered, "No, it is not!"
and these were his last words. In that exquisite story,
the "Vicar of Wakefield,"<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> we have the explanation
of how he supported himself while on his travels.
"I had some knowledge of music," he says, "and
now turned what was once my amusement into a present
means of subsistence. Whenever I approached a
peasant's house towards nightfall, I played one of my
most merry tunes; and that procured me not only
a lodging, but subsistence for the next day." Goldsmith's
many faults were all on the amiable side,
though he was perhaps a little inclined to find fault
with his ill-fortune in good set phrases. Sometimes we
are forced to remember that the misery which can so
readily find relief in words of complaint is not dissimilar
to that love which Thackeray thought quite a
bearable malady when finding an outlet in rhyme and
prose. Real suffering and profound sorrow are nearly
always silent in proportion to their depth. It is
evanescent afflictions which most readily find tongue.
"To write well," says Madame de Staël, "we should
feel truly; but not, as Corinne did, heartbreakingly."
If Goldsmith did grumble, he had bitter cause. At
one time having pawned everything that would bring
money, he resorted to writing ballads at five shillings
apiece, going out secretly in the evening to
hear them sung in the streets. His five shillings were
often shared with some importunate beggar. One day
he gave away his bed-clothes to a poor woman who
had none; and then, feeling cold at night, he ripped
open his bed and was found lying up to his chin in the
feathers! The very name of Goldsmith seems to us
to ring with a generous tone of unselfishness and
human sympathy. The story is true of his leaving the
card-table to relieve a poor woman whose voice as
she sang some ditty in passing on the street came to
his sensitive ear indicating distress. Not a line
can be found in all his productions where he has
written severely against any one, though he was himself
the subject of bitter criticism and literary abuse.
He was not a very thorough reader of books, but owed
his ability as a writer more to the keenness of his observation.
Nature and life were the books he studied;
which was simply going to the fountain-head for his
information.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p><p>Machiavelli, the renowned Italian statesman, philosopher,
and dramatist, whose picturesque history of
Florence alone would have entitled him to fame, was
entirely misconstrued by the times in which he lived,
suffering imprisonment, torture, and banishment in
the cause of public liberty. Macaulay says of him:
"The name of a man whose genius has illumined all
the dark places of policy, and to whose patriotic wisdom
an oppressed people owed their last chance of
emancipation, passed into a proverb of infamy."
The victim of one age often becomes the idol of the
next. Dante,<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> expatriated, and exiled from wife and
children, is not forgotten. The greatest genius between
the Augustan and Elizabethan ages, an accomplished
musician, a painter of no mean repute, and a
brilliant scholar, he yet enjoyed no contemporary
fame. "The inventor of the spinning-jenny is pretty
sure of his reward in his own day," says Carlyle;
"but the writer of a true poem, like the apostle of
a true religion, is nearly as sure of the contrary."
Dante poured out the deep devotion of his youthful
heart at the feet of that Beatrice whose name he has
rendered classic by the genius of his pen, though she
did not live to bless him. His later marriage was
ill-assorted and unhappy. The sublime and unique
"Divine Comedy" was not even published until after
its author's death. Now the pilgrim bends with reverence
over the grave whither he was hurried by persecution.
How absurd are the transitions of which human
appreciation is capable! Even the cool, philosophical
Carlyle was struck with admiration of the poet's devotion.
He says: "I know not in the world an affection
equal to that of Dante. It is a tenderness, a trembling,
longing, pitying love, like the wail of Æolian harps,&mdash;soft,
soft, like a child's young heart; one likens it to
the song of angels; it is among the purest utterances
of affection, perhaps the very purest that ever came
out of a human soul."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<p>Hard indeed seems to have been the fate of the
Italian dramatist and poet, Bentivoglio, who, after
impoverishing himself in acts of charity, literally selling
all and giving the proceeds to the poor, when old
and miserable was refused admission into a hospital
which he had himself founded in his days of prosperity.
Kotzebue, the German author and dramatist, who
wrote that remarkable play "The Stranger," was a
man beset with morbid melancholy, causing him to
pray for death, which came at last by a murderous
hand.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Philip Massinger, the creator of "Sir Giles
Overreach," a dramatic conception almost worthy of
Shakespeare, despite his rare and wondrous powers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>was the child of adversity. Massinger wrote in conjunction
with Beaumont and Fletcher, they getting
whatever of credit was earned by the three. In those
days, an established writer for the stage would frequently
utilize the brains of others of less note, calling
them to aid in productions which bore only the employer's
name. There seemed to be no sunshine in
Massinger's life; it was all in shadow.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Could anything
be more pathetic than this brief entry in the death
chronicle of a London parish, under date of March 20,
1639: "Buried&mdash;Philip Massinger&mdash;a stranger."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<p>Erasmus, the Dutch scholar and philosopher, defrauded
of his patrimony while an orphan of tender
years, devoted himself to learning, and cheerfully
submitted to every deprivation to secure it. While
pursuing his studies in Paris he was clothed in rags,
and his form was cadaverous from want of food. It
was at this time that he wrote to a friend, "As soon
as I get any money, I will buy first Greek books and
then clothes." Thus nurtured in the school of adversity,
he rose to a proud distinction; and to him, more
than to any other writer, was attributed the success of
the Reformation,&mdash;it being expressively remarked that
he laid the egg which Luther hatched. If it be true
that an atmosphere of hardship is necessary to the
nurture of genius, then certainly Erasmus encountered
the requisite discipline; but as Dr. Johnson
says in his epigrammatic way, "there is a frightful
interval between the seed and the timber." Death
is the dropping of the flower that the fruit may ripen.
Thus fame may follow, but seldom is contemporary;
nor does true genius fail to recognize this. Milton's
ambition, to use his own words, was, "to leave something,
so written, to after ages that they should not
willingly let it die;" and Cato said he had rather
posterity should inquire why no statues were erected
to him, than why they were. Motherwell calls fame
"a flower upon a dead man's heart." Were it otherwise,
were fame contemporary, it would be but the
breath of popular applause, the shallowest phase of
reputation. "I always distrust the accounts of eminent
men by their contemporaries," says Samuel
Rogers. "None of us has any reason to slander
Homer or Julius Caesar; but we find it difficult to
divest ourselves of prejudices when we are writing
about persons with whom we have been acquainted."</p>

<p>It is tears which wash the eyes of poor humanity,
and enable it to see the previously invisible land of
beauty; it is threshing which separates the wheat
from the chaff; every ripened genius has passed its
Gethsemane hours. "The eternal stars shine out
as soon as it is dark enough!" says Carlyle. Izaak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Walton, the delightful biographer and charming miscellaneous
writer, was an humble hosier in London
in early life. It was sorrow caused by the death of
his wife and children in the stived quarters of a
poor city tradesman, which led him finally to turn
his back upon the great metropolis and seek a home
in the country. What seemed to him to be "dim funereal
tapers," proved to be "heaven's distant lamps."
Influenced by the inspiring surroundings of Nature, he
produced his "Complete Angler;" of which Charles
Lamb said, "It might sweeten a man's temper at any
time to read it," and which modern criticism has pronounced
one of the best pastorals in the English language.
Spenser, author of the "Faerie Queene," of
whose birth little is known, died in great destitution,
though he was buried near Chaucer in Westminster
Abbey. Of his poetry Campbell says: "He threw
the soul of harmony into our verse, and made it more
warmly, tenderly, and magnificently descriptive than
it ever was before, or, with a few exceptions, it has
ever been since." The best critics agree that the
originality and richness of his allegorical personages
vie with the splendor of ancient mythology.</p>

<p>Let us not forget to speak of Schiller in his early
indigence and distress, wanting friends and wanting
bread, but yet bravely fighting the battle of life. The
humble cottage is still extant, near Leipsic, where he
wrote the "Song of Joy" in those trying days.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>recall Crabbe, stern poet of life's strivings and hardships,
reduced to the verge of starvation, and only
relieved by the noble charity of Edmund Burke; and
Otway, one of the most admirable of English dramatists,
author of "Venice Preserved," choked to
death by the crust of bread he eagerly swallowed
when weakened by famine. Butler, the author of
"Hudibras,"<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> died in poverty in a London garret.
Santara, the famous French painter, died neglected
and penniless in a pauper hospital. Andrea del
Sarto labored hard and patiently at a tailor's bench
to procure the means of pursuing art; and Benvenuto
Cellini<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> languished in the dungeons of San Angelo.</p>

<p>We have spoken of De Foe in prison, he who produced
two hundred volumes, yet died insolvent. Dr.
Johnson said there was never anything written by
man that was wished longer by its readers, except
"Don Quixote," "Robinson Crusoe," and "Pilgrim's
Progress." The author of "Robinson Crusoe" says
of himself: "I have gone through a life of wonders,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>and am the subject of a great variety of providences.
I have been fed more by miracles than Elijah when
the ravens were his purveyors. In the school of
affliction I have learned more philosophy than at the
academy, and more divinity than from the pulpit.
In prison I have learned that liberty does not consist
in open doors and the egress and regress of locomotion.
I have seen the rough side of the world as
well as the smooth, and have in less than half a year
tasted the difference between the closet of a king
and the dungeon of Newgate." "Talent is often to
be envied," says Holmes, "and genius very commonly
to be pitied; it stands twice the chance of the other
of dying in a hospital, in jail, in debt, in bad repute."</p>

<p>The example of Robert Greene's life carries with it
an impressive moral. He was well educated, taking
his degree at Cambridge, England, and was a successful
playwright and poet; but he was also improvident
and reckless in his life, exhibiting more than the usual
eccentricities of genius. He squandered his patrimony
in dissipation, and died in great poverty. His last
book, "The Groatsworth of Wit bought with a Million
of Repentance," is a book both curious and rare.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>With all his dissipated proclivities, Henry Fielding
had much more genius than Robert Greene. He too
was constantly poor through his own recklessness.
Lady Montagu, who was a kinswoman of his, said:
"He was always wanting money, and would have
wanted it had his hereditary lands been as extensive
as his imagination." And yet he was a marvel of industry,
ever slaving with the pen, writing often under
excruciating pain, and producing his most famous
work, "Tom Jones," as has been said, with an ache
and a pain to every sentence. He was, as usual, very
short of money when this work was finished, and
tried to sell it to a second-class publisher for twenty-five
pounds. Thomson the poet heard of this from
Fielding, and told him to come to Miller the book-publisher.
This individual gave it to his wife to read,
and she bade him to secure it by all means; so the
publisher offered the impecunious author two hundred
guineas for it, and the bargain was closed, to the entire
satisfaction of both parties.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Critics have remarked
upon the similarity between Steele and Fielding, though
attributing the greater genius and learning to the
latter. They were certainly alike in one respect;
namely, as regarded a chronic state of impecuniosity.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>
<p>Fielding said of himself that he had no choice but to be
a hackney writer or a hackney coachman for a living.
His genius deserved a better fate. Owing to his poverty
he was forced to throw upon the market many productions
which he had much better have thrown into
the fire. Fortunately, in literature it is the rule that
the unworthy perishes, and only the good remains.
Many of Fielding's works have a just and lasting
fame, and no library is complete without them. In
spite of his many imperfections, which made brusque
Dr. Johnson refuse to sit at table with him, there was
much that was fine and lovable in Harry Fielding,&mdash;truthful,
generous to a fault, and with wit and wisdom
marvellously combined. Gibbon, speaking of his own
genealogy, refers to the fact of Fielding being of the
same family as the Earl of Denbigh, who, in common
with the imperial family of Austria, is descended
from the celebrated Rodolph of Hapsburg. "While
one branch," he says, "have contented themselves
with being sheriffs of Leicestershire and justices of
the peace, the other has furnished emperors of Germany
and kings of Spain; but the magnificent romance
of 'Tom Jones' will be read with pleasure
when the palace of the Escurial is in ruins and the
imperial eagle of Austria is rolling in the dust."</p>

<p>Justice, like the sword of Damocles, is ever suspended.
Nemesis is not dead, but sleepeth. Sometimes
old age seizes upon an ill-spent life, and gives
us a striking example of the vicissitudes of genius.
Dean Swift, the great master of biting satire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
felicitous analogy, possessing the rarest qualities of
wit, humor, and eloquence, was yet so paradoxical
and inconsistent withal, as to lie under the suspicion
of madness half of his life. Ambitious, talented, ever
seeking preferment, never satisfied, now a busy Whig
and now a noisy Tory, he was a perfect brigand in
politics, and his motto was, "Stand and deliver."
Swift's bitterness, scorn, and subsequent misanthropy
were the sequence of disappointment. "All
my endeavors to distinguish myself," he wrote to
Bolingbroke, "were only for want of a great title
and fortune, that I might be used like a lord by those
who have an opinion of my parts; whether right or
wrong is no great matter." Coarse, sceptical, and
irreligious,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> he was arrogant where he dared to be,
and cautious with his money, though having a reputation
for charity. "If you were in a strait," asks
Thackeray, "would you like such a benefactor? I
think I would rather have had a potato and a friendly
word from Goldsmith, than be beholden to the Dean
for a guinea and a dinner." Heartlessly vibrating
between Stella and Vanessa, to the misery and mortification
of both, he finally married the former, only
to separate from her at the church door. We are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>fain to abhor the man while we freely acknowledge
the lustre of his genius, and to see only providential
justice in his fate, when in the later years of his life,
grown morose, misanthropic, and solitary, watched
at all times by a keeper, his memory and other faculties
failed him, and the great Dean became a picture
of death in life. He made many enemies, and was
bitterly criticised by his contemporaries, often not
without ample justice. He has been stigmatized as
"the apostate politician, the perjured lover, and the
ribald priest,&mdash;a heart burning with hatred against
the whole human race, a mind richly laden with
images from the gutter and the lazar-house."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>At complete antipodes to this portrait is that of
Richard Steele, the popular dramatist, essayist, and
editor; the friend of Addison, and one of the wittiest
and most popular men of his day. His also was an
erratic career, alternating between vice and virtue; or,
as he says of himself, always sinning and repenting,
until he finally outlived his relish for society, his income,
and his health. "He was the best-natured
creature in the world," says Young; "even in his
worst state of health he seemed to desire nothing but
to please and be pleased." Worn out and forgotten
by his contemporaries, Steele retired into the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>and left posterity to appreciate his genius. With a
warm heart overflowing with love of wife and children,
his checkered life was yet full of faults and careless
blunders, many of which were directly traceable to
strong drink. Little learned in books, but with a
large knowledge of men and the world, he wrote with
captivating simplicity and in the most colloquial style.
Social and kindly in the extreme, his whole character
is in strong contrast with the harshness of Swift
and the dignified loneliness of Addison.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Somehow
we forget about the sword of Damocles, and ignore
Nemesis altogether in connection with the name of
Steele; and while we do not forget his weaknesses, we
recollect more readily his loving nature, his appreciation
of beauty and goodness, and his warm sympathy
and kindness of heart. It was Steele who said of a
noble lady of his time, that to love her was a liberal
education.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson spent much of his early life in penury,
wandering in the streets, sometimes all night, without
the means to pay for a lodging. A garret was a luxury
to him in those days.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Alas! what a satire upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>learning and authorship! Notwithstanding his powerful
intellect, he was subject to such a singular and
even superstitious dread of death, that he could hardly
be persuaded to execute his will in later years. When
Garrick showed Johnson his fine house and grounds
at Hampton Court, the mind of the great lexicographer
reverted to his special weakness, saying, "Ah!
David, David, these are the things which make a
death-bed terrible." When he and Garrick both became
famous, they used to chaff each other about who
came to London with two shillings, and who had two-and-sixpence.
Johnson was a confirmed hypochondriac;
hence the gloom and morbid irritability of his
disposition. His disorder entailed upon him perpetual
fretfulness and mental despondency. Had it not been
for the wonderful vigor of his mind,&mdash;as in the case
of Cowper, who was similarly affected,&mdash;he would
have been the inmate of a mad-house. Macaulay says
of Johnson grown old: "In the fulness of his fame,
and in the enjoyment of a competent fortune, he is
better known to us than any other man in history.
Everything about him, his coat, his wig, his figure, his
face, his scrofula, his St. Vitus's dance, his rolling
walk, his blinking eye, the outward signs which too
clearly marked his approbation of his dinner, his insatiable
appetite for fish-sauce and veal-pie with plums,
his inextinguishable thirst for tea, his trick of touching
the posts as he walked, his mysterious practice
of treasuring up scraps of orange-peel, his morning
slumbers, his midnight disputations, his contortions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
his mutterings, his gruntings, his puffings, his vigorous,
acute, and ready eloquence, his sarcastic wit, his
vehemence, his indolence, his fits of tempestuous rage,
his queer inmates, old Mr. Levitt and blind Mrs. Williams,
the cat Hodge and the negro Frank,&mdash;are all
as familiar to us as the objects by which we have been
surrounded from childhood."</p>

<p>The greatest talents are usually coupled with the
most acute sensibility. Rousseau imagined a phantom
ever by his side; Luther had his demon, who frequented
his study at all hours. So realistic was the
great reformer's imagination, that he was accustomed
to throw at the intruder any article nearest at hand.
The confusion thus caused may easily be conceived
when on one such occasion he cast his inkstand, with
its contents, at the supposed demon. Cowper's weird
and fatal messenger will also be remembered. Tasso's
spirits glided in the air,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> and Mozart's "man in black"
induced him to write his own requiem. But Johnson
saw omens in the most trifling circumstances. If he
chanced, in passing out of the house, to place his left
foot foremost, he would return and start with the
right, as promising immunity from accident and a
safe return. Strange as it may seem, this eminent
and profound man put faith in a long list of equally
ridiculous omens in every-day life. He was a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>voluminous and versatile writer, and excelled in delineating
female characters; though Burke did say "all
the ladies of his dramatis personæ were Johnsons in
petticoats." Few persons with means so limited as
his ever spent more for charitable purposes; and if
his disposition was irritable, his heart was kind.
"He loved the poor," says Mrs. Thrale, "as I never
yet saw any one else love them. He nursed whole
nests of people in his house, where the lame, the blind,
the sick, and the sorrowful found a sure retreat."
Now and then, throughout Johnson's life, we get a
glimpse that shows us the man, not as the world at
large knew him, but as his unmasked heart appeared.
Does the reader recall the incident of his kneeling by
the dying bed of an aged woman, and giving her a
pious kiss, afterwards recording, "We parted firmly,
hoping to meet again"?</p>

<p>Melancholy has been the very demon of genius, the
skeleton in the closet of poets and philosophers.
Burton composed his "Anatomy of Melancholy" to
divert his own depressed spirits.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Cowper is another
example. He says of himself, "I was struck with
such a dejection of spirits as none but they who
have felt the same can have the least conception
of." He was tenderly attached, it will be remembered,
to his cousin Theodora, who returned his
love; but disappointment was the lot of both, as
her parents, doubtless for good reasons, forbade the
union. While the vastly humorous and popular ballad
of "John Gilpin" was delighting the Londoners,
and was being read to crowded audiences at high
prices, the poor unhappy author was confined as a
lunatic, and, to use his own words, was "encompassed
by the midnight of absolute despair."<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> The poet, like
the clown in the ring, when he appears before the
public must be all smiles and jests, though concealing
perhaps an agony of physical or mental suffering.
We know little of the real aspect which the face of
Harlequin presents beneath his mask. Be sure he
has his sorrows, deep and dark, in spite of the grinning
features which he wears. Who does not recall
the words which Thackeray makes his old and faithful
gold pen utter:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I've help'd him to pen many a line for bread;<br />
To joke, with sorrow aching in his head;<br />
And make your laughter when his own heart bled."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span><br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was there ever pleasanter or more genial reading
than "Cowper's Familiar Letters," full to the brim
with sparkling humor? Yet these were coined from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>his brain while in a state of hopeless dejection. "I
wonder," he writes to Mr. Newton, "that a sportive
thought should ever knock at the door of my intellect,
and still more that it should gain admittance. It is
as if Harlequin should introduce himself into the
gloomy chamber where a corpse is deposited in state."
He was one of the most amiable and gifted, but also
one of the unhappiest, of the children of genius.</p>

<p>Christopher Smart, poet, scholar, and prose writer,
was an eccentric individual, but of such undoubted
ability as to challenge the admiration and win the
friendship of Dr. Johnson, who wrote his biography.
His habits finally became very bad, so that, delirium
setting in, it was found necessary to confine him in
an asylum. While there he wrote a very remarkable
religious poem entitled the "Song of David," produced
in his rational moments, which exhibited sublimity
and power, and is still considered one of the curiosities
of English literature. Smart improved in
health and was discharged with his full reason restored,
but was soon after committed to the King's
Bench prison for debt; and there he died, poverty-stricken
and neglected, in 1770. Samuel Boyle was a
contemporary of Smart, and was possessed of equal
genius whether with the pen or the bottle. Poor fellow!
he got an indifferent living as a fag author,
though he was capable of fine literary work. His
poem entitled the "Deity" fully proved this. Ogle,
the London publisher, used to employ Boyle to translate
some of Chaucer's tales into modern English,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
which he did with much excellence and spirit, and for
which he received threepence per printed line. The
poor genius sank lower and lower, lived in a miserable
garret, wearing a blanket about his shoulders, having
no vest or coat, and was at last found famished to
death with a pen in his hand. "Hunger and nakedness,"
says Carlyle, "perils and revilings, the prison,
the cross, the poison-chalice, have in most times and
countries been the market price the world has offered
for wisdom, the welcome with which it has greeted
those who have come to enlighten and purify it.
Homer and Socrates and the Christian apostles belong
to old days; but the world's Martyrology was
not completed with them."</p>

<p>Richard Payne Knight, the Greek scholar and antiquary,
was a remarkable genius in his way. His
gift of ancient coins, bronzes, and works of art presented
to the British Museum was valued at fifty
thousand pounds. He was a poet of more than ordinary
ability, and wrote, among other prose works,
"An Analytical Enquiry into the Principles of Taste."
He was for a number of consecutive years a member
of Parliament. He had singular attacks of melancholy,
and finally developed such a loathing of life
that he destroyed himself with poison.</p>

<p>Poverty has nearly always been the patrimony of
the Muses. "An author who attempts to live on the
manufacture of his imagination," says Whipple, "is
constantly coquetting with starvation." A glance at
the brief life of Chatterton is evidence enough of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
truth of this remark. He began to write poems of
extraordinary merit at an immature age, and when a
mere boy came up to London to seek for literary employment
as a means of support. He wrote sermons,
poems, essays, and political articles with an ability
far beyond his years. He was indeed a prodigy of
genius, and probably would have stood in the front
rank of English poets had he lived to maturer years.
No one ever equalled him at the same age, and Tasso
alone, says Campbell, can be compared to him as a
youthful prodigy. His life in the metropolis was one
of great hardship and deprivation, as he often suffered
for want of the simplest necessities of life, and grew
so emaciated in appearance from the lack of food
that strangers, sometimes meeting him in the street,
forced him to accept a dinner which he was too proud
to ask for. All this while, with much more consideration
for the feelings of the family at home than
thought for himself, he wrote cheerful letters to his
mother, and even sent small and acceptable presents
to his sister, in order to content them for his absence.
Seeking only expression for the divine afflatus within
him, he had no thought of self, no care for the morrow.
By degrees, young as he was, he sank into utter
despondency, and was reduced to actual starvation.
He was found at last upon his bed of straw, having
taken his own life in a fit of desperation. At the
time he swallowed the fatal poison he was not quite
nineteen years of age.</p>

<p>George Combe, the English author, encountered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
full share of the vicissitudes of genius. He was capable
of much theoretical goodness, but was not practical
in that respect. He wrote in his old age, "Few
men have enjoyed more of the pleasures and brilliance
of life than myself;" yet he died in the King's Bench,
where he had taken refuge from his creditors, not leaving
enough to pay the expenses of his funeral.</p>

<p>Many a child of genius has been compelled to
prostitute godlike powers to repel the gnawings of
hunger; as for instance Holzman, the sagacious Oriental
scholar and professor of Greek, who sold his
notes on Dion Cassius for a dinner. The record of
this learned man's struggles with dire want form
a pathetic chapter in literary history. He tells us
himself that at the age of eighteen he studied to
acquire glory, but at twenty-five he studied to get
bread.</p>

<p>While these pages are preparing for the press, Dr.
Moshlech, a scientist, and the master of ten languages,
has died in the county almshouse of Erie, Pennsylvania.
He was a Prussian by birth, and graduated
with high honors from the University of Bonn; made
medicine a specialty, and practised the profession for
several years in Paris, but finally turned his attention
to science, and afterwards to the languages. He numbered
among his friends many illustrious men, chief
of whom were Darwin and Victor Hugo. At the beginning
of our late war he visited this country, and
accepted a position as Professor of Greek and Hebrew
in Bethany College, West Virginia, which he held but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a short time, owing to the war excitement. He subsequently
practised medicine in Ohio and Pennsylvania,
and wrote for scientific publications. He was
so much interested in his work that he neglected to
make provision for his old age; and when he could
no longer pursue his profession, this man, who had
associated with the most learned men of Europe, was
compelled to apply to a poorhouse for shelter and
bread. Even after he entered the almshouse he prepared
a number of young men for college, and lectured
occasionally before the Erie Historical Society.</p>

<p>Few authors are so calm of spirit, or so assured of
their position, as not to shrink from well-expressed
criticism, and especially when it comes in the form of
ridicule,&mdash;forgetting that although an ass may bray
at a classic statue, an ass cannot create one.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> So sensitive
was even Newton to critical attacks, that Whiston,
another English philosopher, and a personal friend of
Sir Isaac, said he was quite unmanned when any declaration
of his was called in question by the reviewers;
and further, that he (Whiston) lost Newton's favor,
which he had enjoyed for twenty years, by contradicting
him on some point of his printed works; "for," he
adds, "no man was of a more fearful temper." Some
critics use the pen as the surgeon does the scalpel:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>they do not analyze, but they dissect. The flowers of
the imagination, like the life of the body, vanish if
too closely pressed. "Criticism," says Richter, "often
takes from the tree caterpillar and blossoms together."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
Thus was the heart of poor Keats crushed and broken
by the malignant severity of Gifford in the "Quarterly
Review." One would have thought that this captious
critic, who by his own talent alone had worked his
way from the cobbler's bench to the editorial chair of
the "Quarterly," would have been more considerate
towards a man<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> who, like himself, rose from humble
associations. It only proved that the man who had
successfully cast the slough of vulgar life, had still
the heart of a clown. Gifford was indignant and
sensitive beyond measure at a published criticism on
his translation of Juvenal, which appeared in the
"Critical Review;" and he put forth a sharp, angry
answer, in the form of a large quarto pamphlet. No
poet ever exhibited a more vivid perception of the
beautiful, or greater powers of fancy, than Keats; but
the bitterness of the criticism referred to was too
much for his delicate health and sensitive nature,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>hastening, if it did not actually develop, the seeds of
consumption, of which he died. Keats's father was a
livery-stable keeper, and it is said that the future poet
was born in the most humble quarters; but the
irresistible fire of genius lighted his path, and had he
lived past the noon of life, he would have carved his
way to the highest fame. He finally went to Rome,
in the hope of recuperating his failing health; but
that was not to be. In the last day of his illness a
companion who had called in, asked him how he was.
"Better, my friend," he answered in a low voice.
"I feel the daisies growing over me!" He died at
Rome in his twenty-sixth year, Feb. 23, 1821. His
body lies in the English burial-ground outside the
gates of the ancient city, by the Appian Way, and
near to the pyramid of Cestius. The simple slab that
marks the spot interests one quite as much as many
of the grand historical monuments of the Via Appia.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
We all remember the touching epitaph from his own
pen:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Here lies one whose name was writ in water."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>As to the effect of criticism in general, we are told
that Pope was observed to writhe in his chair on hearing
the letter of Cibber mentioned, with other severe
criticism on the product of his hand and brain. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>strictures, deserved and undeserved, which were publicly
made on Montesquieu are said to have hastened
his death. Ritson's extreme sensitiveness to criticism
ended in lunacy, and Racine is thought by many
to have died from the same cause.</p>

<p>Surely disappointment tracks the path of genius.
Thus Collins, the eminent lyric poet, whose "Ode to
the Passions" has made his name famous and familiar
in our day, did not live to enjoy his literary success;
indeed, his death is known to have been hastened by
long neglect. The last half of his brief life was darkened
by melancholy,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and his home was a lunatic
asylum. The money received from his publishers as
copyright on his poems he voluntarily refunded, also
paying the entire expense of the edition, after which
he made a bonfire of the sheets. As we have seen in
so many other instances, it was left for posterity to
do Collins justice. In the course of a single generation,
without any adventitious aid to bring them into
notice, his poems have come to rank among the best
of their kind in the language. Poor Collins! unfortunate
in love, threatened with blindness, and harassed
by bailiffs half his life, his career was one of unrest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>unhappiness, and despair; death, the comforter of him
whom time cannot console, gave the poet an early
grave.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>Small was the portion of happiness that fell to
the share of these men of genius; the lonely places
they occupied were too lofty for companionship.
"The wild summits of the mountains are inaccessible,"
says Madame Necker; "only eagles and reptiles
can get there." We have seen how hard appears the
fate of genius as a rule, and that its possession is
often at the cost of great deprivation and unhappiness.
Is it not difficult to recall an instance where a
pronounced genius has also enjoyed the quiet beauty
of domestic life? Wordsworth's remark, however,
is applicable: namely, that men do not make their
homes unhappy because they have genius, but because
they have not enough genius. The conclusion would
seem to be that we may envy talent, but must
oftenest pity genius.</p>

<p>About half a century since, the well-known indiscretions
of Shelley caused his name to be tabooed in
London society, though in moral attributes he stood
immeasurably above his friend Byron. Still, he was
amenable enough to censure. His poetry is strikingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>brilliant; each line is a complete thought, and the
whole sparkles like sunlight upon the sea. After being
expelled from college he made a "Gretna Green"
marriage with Harriet Westbrook, but eventually
abandoned her with his two children,&mdash;the woman
who had given up all for him, and who in her dark
hour of sorrow and despair drowned herself.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> We can
describe Shelley's character no better than by comparing
it to his longest poem, the "Revolt of Islam,"
which abounds in passages of surpassing beauty, but
which as a whole is deficient in connection and human
interest. It is as erratic as his own life.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> There is
so much of bad in the best, and of good in the worst,
that few of us are willing to sit in judgment upon
poor humanity. Time has softened the asperity of
our feelings, and the productions of Shelley's genius
are now justly admired. When, after his fatal accident,
his body was washed on shore, a copy of Keats's
poems was found in his pocket. His ashes now rest
near those of his brother poet outside the gates of
Rome. As a striking example of his remarkable sensibility,
we may mention the effect upon him when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>he first listened to the reading of Coleridge's "Christabel"<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
in a small social circle. Says one who was
present, "Shelley was so affected that he fainted
dead away." He was consistent, and lived up to his
convictions. While listening to the organ in an
Italian cathedral, he sighed that charity instead of
faith was not regarded as the substance of religion.
The maintenance of his opinion cost him a fine estate,
so constant and profuse were his charities
towards impoverished men of letters and the poor
generally.</p>

<p>The author of an "Elegy Written in a Country
Church-Yard"<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> was absolutely a slave to diffidence
and painful shyness,&mdash;a characteristic which led to
bitter persecution while he was a young student; nor
could he ever quite divest himself of this nervous
timidity. Hazlitt says of Gray that "he was terrified
out of his wits at the bare idea of having his
portrait prefixed to his works, and probably died
from nervous agitation at the publicity into which
his name had been forced by his learning, taste, and
genius." On the death of Cibber, the vacant laureateship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>was offered to Gray, but his sensitiveness led
him to decline it.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p class="large center p4">CHAPTER VII.</p>


<p>In these desultory chapters we have more than once
seen that fame appeals to posterity; but in the instance
of Byron it was contemporary, for he tells us
he "awoke one morning and found himself famous."
No man's errors were ever more closely observed and
recorded than his; and we are still too near the period
of his life to forget his foibles and remember only the
productions of his genius. Byron, like Pope, was a
sufferer from physical deformity, and much of the
morbid sensibility of both arose from their common
misfortune. Macaulay, speaking of Byron, says:
"He had naturally a generous and feeling heart, but
his temper was wayward and irritable. He had a
head which statuaries loved to copy, and a foot the
deformity of which the beggar in the street mimicked.
Distinguished at once by the strength and by the
weakness of his intellect, affectionate yet perverse, a
poor lord and a handsome cripple, he required, if ever
man required, the finest and most judicious training.
But capriciously as Nature had dealt with him, the
parent to whom the office of forming his character
was intrusted was more capricious still. She passed
from paroxysms of rage to paroxysms of tenderness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
At one time she stiffled him with her caresses; at
another time she insulted his deformity. He came into
the world; and the world treated him as his mother
had treated him,&mdash;sometimes with fondness, sometimes
with cruelty, never with justice. It indulged
him without discrimination, and punished him without
discrimination. He was truly a spoiled child,&mdash;the
spoiled child of fortune, the spoiled child of fame, the
spoiled child of society." The author of "Don Juan"
was actuated at times by a strange recklessness, and
a desire to seem worse than he really was. He aped
the misanthrope, assumed unfelt remorse, and affected
singularity, in order to court notoriety. However
capricious may have been his temper, he came rightly
enough by it, since his mother was noted for the
frenzied violence of her passion, being wholly without
judgment or self-control, and in nearly every respect
disqualified for performing a parent's duty.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Byron
was also a victim of hypochondria only in a less degree
than Johnson and Cowley; and this is his one
genuine excuse for the excesses into which he sometimes
rushed headlong. No matter in what light we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>consider him, all must concede the fervor of his passionate
genius; and therein lay his remarkable power,
for man is at his greatest when stimulated by the
passions. Enthusiasm is contagious, and infuses a
spirit of emulation; while reason, calm and forcible,
only wins us by the slow process of conviction.</p>

<p>The truest grandeur of our nature is often born of
sorrow. Those who have suffered most have developed
the profoundest sympathies and have sung for
us the sweetest notes. It is the heart which is seamed
with scars that compels other hearts. Charles Lamb,
at one time himself confined in an insane asylum,
lived to the end of his days with, and in charge of, an
unfortunate sister, who in a fit of madness murdered
her mother,&mdash;an experience sufficient to cast, as it
did, an awful blight over his whole life; but it was
the occasion in him of an instance of holy human
love and pure self-denial seldom equalled. Poor Mary
Lamb<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> knew when these mental attacks were coming
on, and then her brother and herself, hand in hand,
sought the asylum, to the matron of which he would
say, "I have brought Mary again;" and presently,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>when the attack had passed, he was at the door of
the asylum to receive her once more and take her
kindly home. The domestic tragedy and his sister's
condition caused Lamb to give up all idea of marriage,
though at the time of the sad occurrence he was
sincerely attached to a lovely woman. The court,
after Mary's trial, consigned her to her brother's care.
He wrote to his friend Coleridge, "I am wedded to
the fortunes of my sister and my poor old father."
The father died not long subsequent, but Mary survived
Charles thirteen years, dying in 1847. With
considerable ability as a versifier, Lamb will not be
remembered as a poet; his fame will rest on his
essays and his sagacious criticisms. The "Essays of
Elia" are inimitable, full of the author's personality,
exquisitely delicate, poetical, whimsical, witty, and
odd. The only fault to be reasonably found with
them is their brevity. We wish there were a dozen
volumes in place of one. They are the pedestal upon
which the fame of this gentle, charitable, and quaint
genius will ever rest. Lamb's character was amiably
eccentric, but always full of loving-kindness. The
pseudonym of "Elia" has become famous, and was
first assumed in the author's contributions to the "London
Magazine." While his lovable disposition and
pensive cast of thought tinge all his productions,
there is ever a playfulness lurking just below the surface
which is sure to captivate the most casual reader.
During his life Lamb was looked upon by the world as
possessing more oddity than genius; but now all join<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
in admitting him to be one of the fixed stars of literature.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
What a significant fact it is that Lamb was so
tenderly regarded by the galaxy of notable men with
whom he associated! He was a schoolmate of Coleridge
and intimate with him for fifty years. Southey,
Hazlitt, Wordsworth, Godwin, De Quincey, Edward
Irving, Thomas Hood, Leigh Hunt, and other men of
literary fame were the warm and loving friends of
Charles Lamb.</p>

<p>With all his æsthetic proclivities, "Elia" was of
a sensuous nature. Besides roast pig, he had other
favored dishes, not rare and luxurious, but special,
nevertheless. He was particularly fond of brawn, and
considered tripe to be superlatively appetizing when
suitably prepared. He was also a connoisseur in all
sorts of drinks; not that he was extravagant,&mdash;on the
contrary, he was to a degree self-denying, and even
with all his little generosities and his care of his sister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>Mary he managed to leave two thousand pounds,
saved out of his always moderate income, to make
that sister comfortable. He wrote to Wordsworth:
"God help me! I am a Christian, an Englishman, a
Londoner, a Templar. When I put off these snug
relations and go to the world to come, I shall be like
a crow on the sand." Lamb said that oftentimes
absurd images forced themselves with irresistible
power upon his mind,&mdash;such, for instance, as an elephant
in a coach office gravely waiting to have his
trunk booked; or a mermaid over a fish-kettle cooking
her own tail!<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Wordsworth&mdash;to whom we have already alluded
more than once&mdash;was at times distressingly poor,
and in such straitened circumstances that he and
his family denied themselves meat for days together.
Had it not been for the admirable influence of his
sister Dorothy, who cheered his spirits and counteracted
his morbid tendencies, his mind might have
drifted into something like insanity. His disappointment
was great at the comparative failure of his
literary work, which brought him little in the way of
pecuniary return during his life. A fortunate legacy
and comparatively sinecure office, however, finally
afforded him humble independence.</p>

<p>It seems gratuitous to refer to the natural weakness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>of so pure and good a man as Wordsworth, but we
have tried to be impartial in these pages. Grand
and simple as our poet was, he had the element of
vanity snugly stowed away among his attributes, yet
ready to betray itself on occasion. It is related that
sometimes when he met a little child he would stop
and ask him to observe his face carefully, so that in
after years the child might be able to say he had seen
the great Wordsworth. "Wordsworth," says Charles
Lamb, "one day told me that he considered Shakespeare
greatly overrated. 'There is,' said he, 'an
immensity of trick in all Shakespeare wrote, and
people are taken by it. Now, if I had a mind, I
could write exactly like Shakespeare!' So you see,"
added Lamb, "it was only the mind that was wanting!"
The late James T. Fields, who was a hearty
admirer and personal friend of the poet, said, "Yes,
Wordsworth was vain; but think for a moment what
he has produced, and how much he had in him to be
self-conscious of!"</p>

<p>Colton, better known by his <i>nom de plume</i> of
"Lacon," is a vivid illustration of the eccentricities
of genius. Though he was a man whose personal
character is entirely unworthy of our respect, yet no
one can deny that he was endowed with marked and
original powers. He comes before us in our day
simply as the author of his remarkable Laconics,
full of spontaneous thoughts happily expressed, and
which will compare favorably with the apothegms of
Bacon or the terse brevities of Rochefoucauld. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
eccentricities and irregularities of Colton are almost
too extravagant for belief, and certainly will not bear
rehearsal. At one and the same time a clergyman of
fair repute and the secret companion of sporting-men
and gamblers, he was always playing a double part.
He was the author of several important pamphlets
and some excellent poetry, and, when abroad, the
well-paid correspondent of the London press. Notwithstanding
the wit and consummate wisdom of the
volume which made him famous, it must be admitted
that he was incapable of appreciating what was grand
and noble in principle. Deeply in debt, he fled to
Paris to escape the importunities of his creditors,
where he became a confirmed and undisguised gambler.
Here at one time he realized such an extraordinary
run of luck as to break a famous bank, becoming
the possessor of nearly thirty thousand pounds. His
experience was like that of nearly every one who becomes
suddenly rich in a similar manner. He lost
every penny of his winnings within a few weeks, and
retired to Fontainebleau, where he ended his life by
suicide.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> In future generations, when his personal
career is forgotten, his one remarkable literary monument
will still remain, like the column of Luxor,
imperishable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<p>It is known to every mathematician that the regular
gambler must lose in the end, even though he may
"break the bank" now and then. Even if the bank
is honestly conducted, all the chances are against
him. The theory of probabilities has become almost
an exact science. Arago,&mdash;the famous French astronomer
and natural philosopher,&mdash;when consulted
by a gentleman who was infatuated with the terrible
vice of gambling, told him, within a few francs, how
much he had lost the preceding year. "But I must
play," was the answer. "It is true that I find my
fortune diminishing every year, as you have stated;
but can you not tell me how, on a capital of five
million francs, I may save enough to give me a decent
burial in the end?" Arago, after learning the
gambler's method of playing, and the sum he risked,
told him that he must reduce the amount of his daily
ventures to a certain small number of francs, and
that, according to the law of chances, however cool
and calm his playing, he would lose his five million
francs in about fifteen years. Every body of stockholders
in a faro bank can calculate on twenty per cent
of their investment being returned to them yearly.</p>

<p>Could genius enjoy the advantage of being judged
by its peers, it would stand a better chance for contemporary
fame; but overshadowed, as it so often is,
by foibles, waywardness, and those passions alike
common to the humble and the exalted, it must
pass through the crucible of time to fit it for sincere
homage. Robert Burns, whose struggle with fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
began almost beside the cradle, and whose youth was
one ceaseless buffeting with misfortune, is an illustration
in point. His productions are not of a character
to set aside altogether the remembrance of his follies,
though we are all inclined to treat the memory of the
Scottish bard with indulgence and half reverence, while
we hasten to acknowledge his great and unquestioned
genius. Burns was sadly addicted to whiskey and
tobacco, which led Byron, as we have already said,
to call him "a strange compound of dirt and deity."
The author of "Childe Harold" forgot the proverb
about those who live in glass houses. Burns, from
early youth, was subject to extraordinary fits of dejection,
which amounted to a species of hypochondria,
long before convivial society had inoculated him with
the then popular vice of intemperance. He became
finally an incongruous mixture of mirth and melancholy,
while poverty with its attendant ills was seldom
from his door. He writes to a friend: "I have been
for some time pining under secret wretchedness; the
pang of disappointment, the sting of pride, and some
wandering stabs of remorse settle on my vitals like
vultures when my attention is not called away by the
claims of society or the vagaries of the Muse." Poor,
ill-fated genius!<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> By his follies and indulgences he
as surely committed suicide in his thirty-seventh year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>as did the starving, half-delirious Chatterton on his
bed of straw.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dunlop, an early patroness of Burns, had in
her family an old and favored housekeeper, who did
not exactly relish her mistress's attention to a man
of such low estate. In order to overcome her prejudice,
her mistress induced the domestic to read one
of Burns's poems, the "Cotter's Saturday Night."
When Mrs. Dunlop inquired her opinion of the poem,
the housekeeper replied with quaint indifference,
"Aweel, madam, that's vera weel." "Is that all
you have to say in its favor?" asked the mistress.
"'Deed, madam," she replied, "the like o' you quality
may see a vast in 't; but I was aye used the like o'
all that the poet has written about in my ain father's
house, and atweel I dinna ken how he could hae
described it any other gate." When Burns heard
of the old woman's criticism, he remarked that it
was one of the highest compliments he had ever
received.</p>

<p>The name of Thoreau suggests itself in this connection.
He lived in a cabin erected by himself on the
borders of Walden Pond, a voluntary hermit, frugal
and self-denying, that he might enjoy a studious retirement.
The intimate friend of Emerson and Hawthorne
must have had fine original qualities to commend
him. Known at the outset only as an oddity, he
grew finally to be respected and admired for his quaint
genius. He experienced a disappointment in love,
which doubtless had much to do with his social pecu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>liarities.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
In business and the affairs of every-day
life he was utterly impracticable. He supported himself
during his college course at Cambridge by teaching
school, doing carpentering, and other work. The
restrictions of society were intolerable to him; he
never attended church, never paid a tax, and never
voted. He ate no flesh, drank no wine, never used
tobacco, and though a naturalist, used neither trap
nor gun. When asked at dinner what dish he preferred,
he answered, "The nearest." "So many negative
superiorities smack somewhat of the prig," says
one of his reviewers. "Time," says Thoreau, in his
fanciful way, "is but a stream I go fishing in. I
drink at it, but while I drink I see the sandy bottom
and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides
away, but eternity remains. I would drink deeper&mdash;fish
in the sky, whose bottom is pebbly with stars."
He worshipped Nature in all her forms, and depicted
with a loving and exuberant fancy hills and water,
with the myriad life which peopled them. He wrote
several books which are read to-day with more of
interest than when the author was alive.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<p>Genius and inspiration are so nearly allied as to
leave no dividing line, and the sublimity of martyrdom
is often added to the column of fame. Joan of Arc,
the most illustrious heroine of history, was born a
poor peasant girl of Lorraine; but at the age of eighteen,
impelled by an exalted enthusiasm, she commanded
an army of devoted followers, and raising the siege of
Orleans gave to Charles VII. a crown. At the age
of thirteen she said she received commands from
Heaven to go and liberate France; and with a confidence
of Divine support she pursued her mission. No
romancer would dare to imagine or portray so glorious a
heroine; fiction could not equal the actual deeds that
this pure and lowly girl accomplished.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> That she
was the agent of Divine Providence to bring about a
great political object goes without saying; yet this
maid of Domremy was burned at the stake.</p>

<p>Rachel, the child of poverty, the itinerant of the
Parisian boulevards, infused with genius, suddenly
became the idol of courts and of princes, being as
devoutly worshipped by the lovers of art on the banks
of the Neva and the Thames as on the shores of her
beautiful Seine. How strange were the vicissitudes
of this wonderful artist, this frail child of genius! An
actress of transcendent dramatic power, she leaves us
the souvenir of a splendid star of histrionic art extinguished
when it burned the brightest. One day, when
Rachel was thus singing and reciting on the public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>street, a benevolent-looking man, with pitying eyes,
was attracted, in passing, by the child's intelligent
look, and put a five-franc piece in her hand. She took
the silver with a grateful courtesy and watched him
until he passed out of sight. A citizen who had seen
the generous act said, "That was Victor Hugo;" and
the child-actress remembered the name ever after.
But little did the great poet anticipate what the pale-faced
child was destined to become in that world of
art of which he was so distinguished a disciple.</p>

<p>Edwin Forrest, our own famous tragedian, was in
Paris in 1836, and was invited by the manager to see
an actress who was to make her début at one of the
theatres on a certain evening. The manager asked
him, in the course of the performance, what he thought
of the débutante. Forrest replied that he feared she
would never rise above mediocrity, and added, "But
that Jewish-looking girl, that little bag of bones, with
the marble face and the flaming eyes,&mdash;there is demoniacal
power in her. If she lives and does not burn
out too soon, she will make a great actress." He
referred to Rachel, then in her fifteenth year. We
all know how that genius developed. Parsimony
was a fixed trait of her character; she could not
help it. "Is it any wonder," she once said to a
friend, "that I should be fond of money, considering
the suffering I went through in my youth to earn a
few sous?"</p>

<p>It appears as if Nature scattered her seeds of genius
to the wind, so many take root and blossom in sterile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
places, and also that she delights to add vigor and
glory to her chance productions. Thus Adelina Patti,
the greatest prima donna of her day, was once a
barefooted child in the streets of New York. Kings
and queens, spellbound by her glorious voice, have
delighted to honor her; but her domestic life was
wrecked at the moment of her greatest professional
triumph. Complete success is granted to none. Some
bitterness is sure to tincture our cup of bliss, for,
after all, it is of earth and not of heaven. Perfection
may exist with angels above, but not among mortals.
The life of genius is beset with extraordinary temptations;
the stimulating spur of praise, flattery, and
high homage should be, but rarely is, counterbalanced
by the curb of reason. We have already seen that
great genius and true domestic happiness are seldom
found under the same roof. The extraordinary development
of certain faculties argues diminution in
others; and where there are extremes, it is ever
difficult to harmonize the various parts.</p>

<p>Miss Landon, the youthful and tender poetess and
novelist, known to the world by her familiar signature
"L. E. L.," coined the treasures of her brain to support
those who were dependent upon her. In one of her
letters she says, "My life, since the age of fifteen
years, has been one incessant struggle with adversity."
Her productions can hardly be said to bear the stamp
of high genius, but they enjoyed a certain popularity
and procured the much-needed money. The mystery
of her early and mournful death is only known in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
heaven. She died from a dose of prussic acid, in her
thirty-sixth year, which was also her bridal year.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p>The infinitely sweet and touching poems of Mrs.
Hemans were the outflow of a heart yearning for
human affection and finding it not. Her domestic
life also proved to be a marked failure. She separated
from her husband after six years of married life, and
never saw him again. Her genius was early developed;
her poems were contributed to the London
press at the age of fifteen.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> She died at the age of
forty-one, worn out by domestic unhappiness and ill
health. She has herself said, "There is strength
deep-bedded in our hearts, of which we reck but little
till the shafts of heaven have pierced its frail dwelling.
Must not earth be rent before her gems are found?"
"It has been the fashion among youthful critics of
late," says Epes Sargent, "to undervalue her productions;
but not a few of these have a charm, a tenderness,
and a spirit which must make them long dear
to the hearts of the many." Her complete works,
containing a tragedy entitled, "The Vespers of Palermo,"
are contained in six volumes. We may also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>recall the sad, sad life of Charlotte Bronté, the poor
curate's daughter, whose orphaned childhood was so
miserable, and whose youth was drudgery as a schoolteacher
at sixteen pounds a year. Under the pressure
of extreme ill health and a heart nearly broken with
sorrow, this daughter of genius produced "Jane
Eyre," a novel of such power, piquancy, and originality
as to take the reading world by storm. She was
finally married, but only to die in her bridal year.
The three daughters of Rev. Patrick Bronté were each
endowed with literary genius, which under happier circumstances
might have developed into famous results.
Charlotte wrote, as we have said, "Jane Eyre;"
Emily wrote "Wuthering Heights," an almost equally
popular novel; and Anne wrote the "Tenant of
Wildfell Hall." The three unitedly published in 1846
"Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell," the sisters'
respective pseudonyms.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The father's income
was one hundred and seventy pounds a year, upon
which to support a family of twelve persons. He
was a man of more than ordinary culture and of
much poetic talent. A volume of his poems was published
in 1811, entitled "Cottage Poems." He survived
his whole family. Many critics have pronounced
"Villette," published by Charlotte a couple of years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>before her death, to be superior in construction and
interest to "Jane Eyre."</p>

<p>It would seem that deep and thoughtful minds, like
deep waters, must have a gloom in them, and that
ideal life leads to turbulence of soul. Nathaniel
Hawthorne, endowed by Nature with an acute and
subtle intellect, always suffered more or less from a
morbid sensibility. Even in his youth, like Burns, he
was oppressed by fits of deep dejection, which gave
his friends much anxiety. His order of genius was
of the highest; of that there is no doubt. His style is
simple, graceful, and forcible, with a power to awaken
intense interest in the characters which he delineated.
The "Scarlet Letter" is perhaps the best
known and most popular of his several productions;
and much of the same half-suppressed, feverish excitement
is realized in its perusal as in a degree
characterized Hawthorne himself. His most prominent
trait as an author lay in his originality and
power of analysis.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>Insanity is often the result of an overtasked sensitive
brain wandering in the realms of fancy. Like
a high-mettled horse, it sometimes throws the rider,&mdash;as
in the instance of Cowper, Collins, and others
already spoken of in these pages. Charles Fenno
Hoffman, the ripe scholar, poet, and novelist, conceded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>to be one of the best song-writers we have had in
America, was bereft of reason and died the inmate
of an insane asylum, where the last quarter of his
life was passed. While yet a boy, Hoffman met with
an accident so serious as to render necessary the amputation
of one of his legs, and thenceforth he was
obliged to go with a wooden one.</p>

<p>Béranger, like De Foe, was at one period the prime
favorite of the Court, and presently was languishing
within the dreary walls of the Bastile, where he
wrote some of his most effective poems. Contemporary
with Béranger was Alfred de Musset, a poet and
littérateur of rare excellence, possessed of a flow of
poetical genius characterized by passion, vivacity, and
grace, notwithstanding that a morbid, misanthropic
frame of mind consumed him in secret. His youthful
liaison with George Sand is familiar to us all, and
no doubt it left a weird influence upon his life. When
De Musset received money he would squander it in
the most reckless dissipation, then live on bread and
onions until he earned another supply, to be lavished
in the same manner. He was the intimate friend of
the Duke of Orleans, Victor Hugo, and other notable
men, but deliberately chose the debasing career of
a drunkard, and died at the premature age of forty-seven,
a victim to the demon of alcohol.</p>

<p>The grandmother of Alexandre Dumas the elder
was an African negress. He enjoyed no educational
advantages, until while yet a mere boy, actuated by a
Bohemian spirit, which always influenced him more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
or less, he wandered away from his native place
(Villers-Cotterets, France), and sought a stranger's
home in Paris. Many of the varied productions of
this prolific and sensual novelist bear testimony to
his African origin, in their savage voluptuousness and
barbaric taste. Dumas was one of the greatest plagiarists
of modern times, so that it was said by his
critics that he introduced the sweating system into
literature. But no intelligent reader can deny that
he was a great genius,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>&mdash;in evidence of which he
possessed the thousand and one conventional characteristics
of the race. At one time he would resort
to all manner of expedients to dodge his creditors
and escape arrest for debt, at another scattering
gold with the most lavish and inconsiderate hand.
Unlike Lamartine, he failed entirely in politics, but
certainly was for years the most popular novelist in
France. Dumas was frequently in the receipt of
large sums in gold from the many popular books
which he wrote. When this money was received it
was placed in a pile upon the table of his sitting-room,
and if appealed to in behalf of a charity,
or asked for aid by an impecunious caller, he sent
the parties to <i>help themselves</i> as long as the pile of
napoleons lasted! Such reckless disregard of reasonable
care for money seems almost incredible; but this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>story is authenticated by his son, the present popular
author and dramatist, Alexandre Dumas.</p>

<p>The life of Douglas Jerrold is still another example
of the mutability of fortune; at first call-boy in a
theatre, then a sailor, and finally a printer's apprentice,
he became at last a famous dramatist, essayist,
wit, and humorist. The anecdote of his first contribution
to the press is perhaps not too familiar to
repeat. He was a youthful compositor in a publishing
office, where he ventured to drop anonymously into the
editor's box a contribution consisting of a criticism on
"Der Freischütz." He lay awake that night thinking
of his venture, and the next morning was rendered
half frantic with joy when his copy was handed to
him to be put into type by his own hands. Appended
to the copy the editor had written a note, asking the
anonymous author for further contributions. Jerrold
became a prominent member of the brilliant coterie
which made "Punch," that daring wag, a great moral
and political power. Many of his best sayings&mdash;flashes
of wit like those of Wycherley, Congreve, and
Sheridan&mdash;rarely found their way into print, being
uttered in small social circles, or in the society of
the London clubs, where he was rather feared for
the keenness of his satire, as he was no respecter of
persons. As a dramatist Jerrold is best known by
those popular plays, "The Rent Day" and "Black-Eyed
Susan,"<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> the latter being still considered the
best nautical drama on the stage. Good-fellowship,
as it is falsely called, was the bane of Jerrold's life;
and though he realized a most liberal income, he
died poor and grievously in debt. During the last
years of his life he was editor of "Lloyd's Weekly
Newspaper," from which he received one thousand
pounds per annum, besides an income of a very handsome
amount for other and various literary work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<p>Charles Dickens, whose early career was not without
its severe discipline, and who was indisputably
one of the greatest literary geniuses of modern times,
certainly shortened his life by free living. He was
extravagantly fond of the pleasures of the table,
and a constant participant in convivial occasions.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
Undoubtedly his domestic infelicity was largely attributable
to a habit of overstimulating, besides which,
brandy and continuous literary effort are incompatible
with each other. His later works will not compare
favorably with his earlier ones. "Our Mutual Friend"
was not worthy of his reputation; and the half of
"Edwin Drood" which was published was not of a
character to make an intelligent reader desire more.
At fifty-eight his brain was failing. Both Dickens
and Thackeray were really sacrificed to the Moloch
of conviviality. The latter was not only a remarkable
novelist, but is entitled to distinct fame as a
poet. He was a man of noble impulses, and charitable
to a fault. He inherited a small fortune, in
the expenditure of which he was very lavish, at one
time giving the impecunious Dr. Maginn five hundred
pounds,&mdash;an unfortunate brother author who appealed
to Thackeray when he was in a strait; and no needy
man was ever refused by the author of "Vanity Fair."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<p>There are few objects which if held up against a
strong light, will not betray some defect. A perfect
emerald was perhaps never seen, and almost as rare
is a perfect diamond; the magnifying-glass is pretty
sure to detect some flaw in the gem, be it never so
small. So the microscope applied to genius is apt to
discover those imperfections of humanity from which
no mortal is entirely exempt. Washington said it
was lamentable that great characters are so seldom
without blot.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> Edgar A. Poe, whose genius has so
lately received public recognition, was left an orphan
at a tender age, thus lacking the moral influence and
training which might have prevented the blight of his
after years. His father was a law-student, and his
mother an actress named Elizabeth Arnold. Heaven
had breathed into his soul the fire of a master-spirit,
but at the same time endowed him with a morbid sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>sitiveness
which rendered his imagination weird and
gloomy. He became the victim of strong drink, and
was thereby marked for an early grave, dying, after
an erratic career, in a public hospital. He was an
editor, critic, and poet, wielding a most witty but
bitterly sarcastic pen. When penniless and in absolute
want, he wrote to a friend, with a supreme contempt
of the very sinews of war for which he was
suffering: "The Romans worshipped their standard,
and the Roman standard happened to be an eagle.
Our standard is only one tenth of an eagle, one dollar,
but we make all even by adoring it with tenfold devotion."
Even in boyhood Poe developed a wild, unruly
disposition, being expelled from the University of
Virginia, and afterwards from the West Point Academy.
The writer of these pages knew Poe personally,
and employed him as a regular contributor to a paper
which the writer was editing. Poe's literary reputation
rests mainly upon one remarkable poem, "The
Raven." Mr. Lowell's portrait of the author of "The
Raven" is both concise and true,&mdash;"three fifths of
him genius and two fifths sheer fudge." He was unquestionably
a man of genius, but wrong-headed from
very childhood.</p>

<p>We must worship our literary heroes and heroines
from afar: indeed, this will apply with force to all
notables; intimacy is pretty sure to disenchant us.
"The love or friendship of such people," says De
Quincey, "rather contracts itself into the narrow
circle of individuals. You, if you are brilliant like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
themselves, they will hate; you, if you are dull, they
will despise. Gaze, therefore, on the splendor of
such idols as a passing stranger. Look for a moment
as one sharing in the idolatry, but pass on before the
splendor has been sullied by human frailty." Admiration
is the offspring of ignorance; even where
familiarity does not breed contempt, it blunts the
keenness of our homage, since to those that know
them best, authors quickly come down from their
pedestals and become only men and women. One of
Byron's biographers lays it down as a rule to avoid
writers whose works amuse you; for when you see
them they will delight you no more, though Shelley,
he admits, was an exception. Mr. Emerson thought
the conditions of literary success almost destructive
of the best social powers. We are told by Lockhart
that Scott could not endure, in London or Edinburgh,
the little exclusive circles of literary society; he
craved the company of men of business and affairs.
"It is much better to read authors than to know
them," says Horace Walpole. Speaking of young
Mr. Burke, he says (in 1761), that although a
remarkably sensible man, "he has not worn off his
authorship yet, and thinks there is nothing so charming
as writers, and to be one. He will know better
one of these days." Even Byron hated authors who
were all author,&mdash;"fellows in foolscap uniform turned
up with ink." Miss Mitford, in the ripeness of her
experience, wrote that authors "as a general rule are
the most disappointing people in the world;" much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
preferring persons who loved letters to those who
followed the profession of authorship. Sir Egerton
Brydges, the prolific writer of sonnets, novels, essays,
letters, etc., says: "I have observed that vulgar
readers almost always lose their veneration for the
writings of the genius with whom they have had personal
intercourse."</p>

<p>We have spoken several times of the remuneration
realized by authors for their literary productions, and
perhaps a few more words upon this subject may be
of interest to the general reader.</p>

<p>In the reigns of William III., Anne, and George I.,
literature, however excellent, could not find a sufficient
market to fairly requite its authors. Intelligent,
cultured men could not realize remunerative incomes
by their pen; so the political chiefs of those days came
forward and extended official patronage to them in
a manner which was often princely and munificent.
Thus Congreve, scarcely yet twenty-one years of age,
was given a place under Government which made
him independent for life. Rowe, poet and dramatist,
author of "Tamerlane," was made under-secretary
of state, and finally became poet-laureate, in 1714.
Hughes, the poet and dramatist, also held a lucrative
Government office; he was the author of the "Siege
of Damascus," a drama, singular to say, which was
played for the first time on the evening of his death.
Ambrose Phillips, an author of similar character,
was made judge of the prerogative court of Ireland.
Locke, the English philosopher, philanthropist, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
voluminous writer, was the recipient of liberal Government
patronage. Newton, it will be remembered, was
made Master of the Royal Mint. Stepney, the poet,
of whom Dr. Johnson said, "He is a very licentious
translator, and does not recompense the neglect of
his author by beauties of his own," was honored by
various appointments, as also was Matthew Prior, of
whom the same critic heartily approved. Gay was
made Secretary of Legation at five-and-twenty,&mdash;he
whom we have seen come up to London and begin
life as a mercer's clerk. Montague is another illustrious
example of those geniuses who may be said to
have enjoyed at least a degree of sunshine as well as
of shadow. His poem on the death of Charles II. led
to his various appointments and his earldom. Steele
was made Commissioner of Stamps, and Swift came
very near being made a bishop.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Addison was appointed
Secretary of State, and Dr. Johnson was the
recipient of a pension. The reader can easily add
instances to such as we have enumerated as those
most readily presenting themselves. In our own day
excellence in literature is much more remunerative,
and in a legitimate business way. Good books sell, and
authors receive fair royalties thereon; but even among
us instances of official recognition for literary merit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
are not wanting. We recall in this connection Bancroft
the historian, as Minister to Germany; Lowell
the scholar and poet, Minister to the Court of St.
James. Hawthorne, Irving, Everett, Motley, Bayard
Taylor, Howells, and others, have all been officially
recognized in a similar manner.</p>

<p class="large center p4">CHAPTER VIII.</p>


<p>Egotism in eminent characters is often amusing to
us, but extremely undignified in them. It is almost
always the betrayal of weakness,&mdash;the tongue of
vanity. He who talks of himself, however humble
the words, exposes a proud heart. Still, as Emerson
says, "there are dull and bright, sacred and profane,
coarse and fine egotists." Carlyle was an egotist of
the first water, and so were many other famous
authors. Demosthenes expressed his pleasure when
even a fishwoman pointed him out in the streets of
Athens. Margaret Fuller once wrote: "I have now
met all the minds of this country worth meeting, and
find none comparable to my own "! The admiration
point is ours; the words evince most insufferable
vanity. No wonder Emerson complained of her
"mountainous me," or that Lowell called the whole
of her being a "capital I." Even the gentle, undemonstrative
Hawthorne was obliged to denounce her
vanity; and yet Margaret was a woman full of kindly
human instinct and of remarkable culture. Dickens
was vain,<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> egotistical, and selfish,&mdash;traits which grew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>upon him as he advanced in years. Thackeray, in
his frank, open way, acknowledged his delight at
being recognized by street gamins as the author of
"Vanity Fair." Hans Andersen, like Dante, confidently
predicted his own future greatness. Kepler declared
that "God has not sent in six thousand years
an observer like myself." Buffon's vanity was proverbial
and ridiculous; and yet the man was not
ridiculous according to Pope's idea, that "every man
has just so much vanity as he lacks understanding,"
for we all know that Buffon was a profound naturalist
and scholar. "I am the greatest historian that ever
lived," wrote Gibbon in his private diary; and Goethe
said, "All I have had to do, I have done in kingly
fashion." Albert Dürer, in reviewing his own work,
wrote, "It cannot be better done." Though he had
in his day many admirers, and has even some at the
present time, we confess that his pictures have no attraction
for us. However, he has unquestionable merit
as an engraver, and was court painter to Charles V.
Ruskin's conceit peeps out everywhere in his writings.
Nothing could be more egotistical than Disraeli's
(Beaconsfield) novels. George Sand boastfully betrays
her own liaison with De Musset in her popular story of
"Elle et Lui." "I shall be read," says Southey, "by
posterity, if I am not read now,&mdash;read with Milton,
and Virgil, and Dante, when poets whose works are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>now famous will only be known through a biographical
dictionary."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Most of the eminent men among the
ancients were superlatively conceited and vain. Plato
quoted the oracle which pronounced him great;
Cæsar frequently commends himself, and so does
Cicero. Pliny puts himself on record as one of this
class when he wrote to Venator: "The longer your
letter was, so much the more agreeable I thought it,
especially as it turned entirely upon my works. I am
not surprised you should find a pleasure in them,
since I know you have the same affection for every
composition of mine as you have for the author."
"A modern instance" occurs to us here. When a
certain distinguished lady asked Lord Brougham, the
great English orator and author, who was the <i>best</i>
debater in the House of Lords, his lordship modestly
replied, "Lord Stanley is the <i>second</i> best, madam."
That some people who despise flatterers do not hesitate
to flatter themselves, is an axiom to the truth
of which we must all subscribe.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to these, Whittier, the Quaker
poet, wrote recently to a correspondent in that gentle,
modest manner which is so characteristic of everything
relating to him: "I have never thought of
myself as a poet in the sense in which we use the
word when we speak of the great poets. I have just
said from time to time the things I had to say, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>it has been a series of surprises to me that people
should pay so much attention to them, and remember
them so long." Voltaire betrayed his conceit when
he attempted to criticise Shakespeare. Balzac and
Victor Hugo were two egotists. "There are only
three writers of the French language," said Balzac,&mdash;"Victor
Hugo, Théophile Gautier, and myself."
Southey, Young, Pope, Dryden, and Wordsworth betrayed
their vanity in an egregious manner. Goldsmith
was conspicuously vain at times. Landor had
a supreme estimate of his own productions, and wrote
to Wordsworth, concerning his "Imaginary Conversations,"
as follows: "In two thousand years there
have not been five volumes in prose equal in their
contents to these."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Voltaire's remark upon Dante
served only to illustrate his own spleen and jealousy.
"His reputation," said the sarcastic Frenchman, "will
continually be growing greater, because there is now
nobody who reads him." As for Voltaire's tragedies,
De Tocqueville said he could not even read them
through, and he doubted if anybody else could.
Scott said he read the "Henriade" through, and
<i>lived</i>, but it was when he was a young man, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>he read everything. Dr. Johnson once acknowledged
that he never read Milton through until he was obliged
to do so in compiling his dictionary. Southey said
he had read Spenser through about <i>thirty</i> times, and
that he could not read Pope once. It was perhaps
singular, but Southey, Coleridge, and Wordsworth
all failed to appreciate Virgil.</p>

<p>Hannah More tells us that on a certain occasion
when she was visiting the Garricks in 1776, David
read aloud to herself and Mrs. Garrick her (Hannah's)
last poem. "After dinner Garrick read 'Sir
Eldred' with all his pathos and all his graces. I
think I was never so ashamed in my life; but he read
it so superbly that I cried like a child. Only think
what a ridiculous thing to cry at the reading of one's
own poetry." In another place she says: "Whether
my writings have promoted the spiritual welfare of
my readers, I know not; but they have enabled me
to do good by private charity and public beneficence.
I am almost ashamed to say that they have brought
me thirty thousand pounds." Burns was affected
almost to tears when he heard for the first time
George Lockhart, of Glasgow, sing his verses. "I'll
be hanged if I knew half their merit until now!" he
said. James Hogg, the "Ettrick Shepherd," wrote,
"I cannot express what my feelings were at first
hearing a song of mine sung by a beautiful young
lady in Ettrick to her harpsichord." One recalls in
this connection the legend told in Rome of Canova's
disguising himself and mingling with the crowd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
citizens that he might hear their comments upon a
newly unveiled statue just completed by his own
hands, and of the great satisfaction he bore away
with him at their commendations. Thomas Hood
could not suppress his pleasure at listening to the
"Song of the Shirt"<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> as sung by the poor sorrowing
work-people in the London streets, adapted to rude
airs of their own composition. Béranger, the song-writer
of France, acknowledged a similar delight in
hearing his verses sung upon the Parisian boulevards
by the common people. Francis Jacox speaks of
the first visit of the old poet Ducis to his beloved
master, Louis XVIII., when that monarch graciously
recited to him some of his own verses. In an ecstasy
of delight Ducis exclaimed: "I am more fortunate
than Boileau or Racine; they recited their verses to
Louis XIV., but my king recites my verses to me!"</p>

<p>Though people are said to be vainer of qualities
which they fondly believe they have than of those
which they do really possess, still we must allow to
genius some latitude in the matter of conceit, since
common people exhibit so much of that spirit on no
capital at all. Dr. Holmes says of conceit, that "it
is to character what salt is to the ocean,&mdash;it keeps it
sweet and renders it endurable." Perhaps the acme
of conceit is reached when Cicero says, "For all my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>toils and pains I have no recompense here; but hereafter,
in heaven, among the immortal gods, I shall look
back on my beloved city, and find my reward in seeing
her made glorious by my career." Horace, referring
to his future fame, says, "I shall not wholly die."</p>

<p>Vanity, says Shakespeare, keeps persons in favor
with themselves who are out of favor with all others.
He was not himself without a portion of that conceit
which he says "in weakest bodies strongest
works;" but there is this difference in his share of
vanity,&mdash;he had, indeed, a genius the gods themselves
might envy. He begins one of his sonnets,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Not marble, nor the gilded monuments<br />
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>And again he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Your monument shall be my gentle verse,<br />
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,<br />
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse<br />
When all the breathers of this world are dead;<br />
You still shall live&mdash;such virtue hath my pen&mdash;<br />
Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Sydney Smith's definition occurs to us here, wherein
he defines vanity as "proceeding from the supposition
of possessing something better than the rest of
the world possesses. Nobody is vain of possessing
two legs and two arms, because that is the precise
quantity of either sort of limb which everybody possesses."
Fielding bluntly tells the truth when he
says, "There is scarcely any man, however much
he may despise the character of a flatterer, but will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
condescend, in the meanest manner, to flatter himself."
We have seen that even Diogenes was gratified
by popular praise, not to say flattered thereby;
while the fact of his occupying so notable and peculiar
an abode argued a degree of pride and vanity.
Did not Thoreau also affect humility in his rudely
built cabin on the borders of Walden Pond? Certainly
the idea of Diogenes and his tub must have
occurred to so classic a scholar as the Concord hermit.
Southey's appeal to posterity to do him justice, in his
letter to his publisher, will be remembered: "My day
and popularity will come when I shall have said good-night
to the world." De Quincey remarks that posterity
is very hard to get at; and Swift thought the
present age altogether too free in laying taxes on the
next. "Future ages shall talk of this; they shall be
famous to all posterity;" whereas their time and
thoughts, he believed, would be taken up with present
things, as ours are now. Carlyle thought Dr. Johnson's
carelessness as to future fame a very remarkable trait
in his character.</p>

<p>The vanity of authors is their shame, and ought
to be their secret. While it does not necessarily detract
from the merit of their excellent productions,
it prejudices all by belittling them in our estimation.
Oftentimes the career of these notables, as we have
seen, has been one of surmounted difficulties and
hardships endured for the sake of their chosen calling,
embittering their nature, perhaps, yet at the same time
tincturing them with an exultant spirit of success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>There are examples in abundance, however, of an
opposite character&mdash;examples of true modesty and
self-forgetfulness&mdash;among poets and authors generally.
The poet Rogers, as well as Whittier, is a happy
example of an equable life with a full share of reasonable
blessings. Referring to his irreproachable career,
Sheridan told Rogers it was easy for happy people to
be good.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"How noiseless falls the foot of time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That only treads on flowers!"</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>says William Robert Spencer. A modest estimate of
self sits gracefully upon genius. Listen to Newton:
"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but
to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing
on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and
then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than
ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered
before me." Scott was very little tainted
with vanity; indeed, he wrote in his diary that no
one disliked or despised the "pap" of praise so heartily
as he did. He said there was nothing he scorned
more, except those persons who seem to praise one in
order to be puffed in return. As a rule, he did not
entertain a very high opinion of literary people, or, as
we have seen, desire to associate with them. He said:
"If I encounter men of the world, men of business,
odd or striking characters of professional excellence
in any department, I am in my element, for they cannot
lionize me without my returning the compliment
and learning something of them."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Some people think praise so pleasant and agreeable
that they cannot have too much of it. Goldsmith
said Garrick was a mere glutton of praise, who swallowed
all he came across and mistook it for renown,&mdash;the
fluffy of dunces. Not actors alone, but writers also,
are endowed with a very ravenous appetite for the
same sort of nutriment. There is a nest of vanity in
almost every breast, and according to Burke it is
omnivorous. Rochefoucauld declared that men had
little to say when not prompted by vanity.</p>

<p>Another example of unbounded self-conceit occurs
to us in the instance of the French poet and dramatist
Scudéri, the protégé of Cardinal Richelieu. His
genius was not to be doubted, but it was deeply shadowed
by his vanity, as made manifest in the preface
to his literary works, which abounds in gasconade
pure and simple. Of his epic poem "Alaric" he
says: "I have such a facility in writing verses, and
also in my invention, that a poem of double its length
would have cost me but little trouble. Although it
contains only eleven thousand lines, I believe that
longer epics do not exhibit more embellishment than
mine." Poor, self-satisfied Scudéri! both he and his
works are very nearly forgotten, though he was an
honored member of the French Academy.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> John
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>Heyward, poet and jester, a court favorite in the days
of Queen Mary, is another example of consummate
vanity. He was among the earliest who wrote English
plays. In a work which he produced, in 1556,
called "The Spider and the Fly," a parable there
are seventy-seven chapters, and at the beginning of
each is a portrait of the author in various attitudes,
either sitting or standing by a window hung with
cobwebs. Dryden honestly declared that it was better
for him to own his failing of vanity than for the
world to do it for him; and adds: "For what other
reason have I spent my life in so unprofitable a
study? Why am I grown old in seeking so unprofitable
a reward as fame? The same parts and
application which have made me a poet might have
raised me to any honors of the gown." Sometimes
Goethe speaks with the true breath of humility, and
sometimes quite the reverse. He says, "Had I
earlier known how many excellent things have been
in existence for hundreds and thousands of years, I
should have written no line; I should have had enough
else to do." And yet Goethe is not only the most
illustrious name in German literature, but one of the
greatest poets of any age or nation.</p>

<p>Eugene Sue,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> who was born in luxury, and who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>need never have written for support, would sit down
to write only in full dress, even wearing, as we have
seen, kid gloves,&mdash;an evidence of vanity which has
a precedent in Buffon, who when found engaged in
literary work was always curled, powdered, ruffled,
and perfumed. N. P. Willis was as dainty in his
dress as in his style of writing; and Emerson's remark
relative to Nature would well apply to him, when he
says, "She is never found in undress." Ruskin, who
lives in a glass house as it regards the matter of self
esteem, charges Goethe with self-complacency, and at
the same time adds that this quality marks a second-rate
character. The reader will not be long in determining
which of the two was the more amenable to
such criticism. Before we dismiss Mr. Ruskin let us
quote a letter of his published not long since, and
written so late as 1881, addressed to Alexander Mitchell.
"What in the devil's name," he writes, "have
you to do with either Mr. Disraeli or Mr. Gladstone?
You are a student at the university, and have no more
business with politics than you have with rat-catching.
Had you ever read ten words of mine with understanding,
you would have known that I care no more for
Mr. Disraeli or Mr. Gladstone than for two old bagpipes
with their drones going by steam; but that I
hate all Liberalism as I do Beelzebub, and that, with
Carlyle, I stand&mdash;we two alone now in England&mdash;for
God and the Queen!" So much for the vanity
and conceit of Mr. John Ruskin.</p>

<p>Pope never saw the inside of a university, or indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of a school worthy of the name. Two Romish priests
attempted at different times to do something for him
as personal tutors, but with little success. "This was
all the teaching I had," he says, "and God knows it
extended a very little way." And yet at the age of
sixteen he thought himself, as he has recorded, "to be
the greatest genius that ever was;" and we are afraid
that this vanity and self-conceit never quite deserted
him. Atterbury compared him to Homer in a nutshell.
Dr. Johnson pronounces Pope's Iliad to be "the
noblest version of poetry which the world has ever
seen; and its publication must therefore be considered
as one of the great events in the annals of learning."
As soon as Pope was pecuniarily able he made himself
a comfortable home, and brought his aged parents
into it and made them happy. He calls his existence
"a long disease;" but if he was "sent into this breathing
world but half made up," Nature compensated him
by the richness with which she endowed his brain.
"In the streets he was an object of pity," says Tuckerman;
"at his desk, a king." Though his life was
embittered in a measure by his physical deformity and
by ill-health, he was not lacking in the tenderness of
heart which forms the key-note to all domestic happiness.
"I never in my life knew," says Bolingbroke,
"a man who had so tender a heart for his particular
friends, or a more general friendship for mankind."
As to his poetry there has always been a great diversity
of opinion, but we think it reached the height of
art. It is therefore difficult to realize the egotism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
which could prompt the following couplet from his
pen in the ripeness of his fame:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I own I'm proud,&mdash;I must be proud, to see<br />
Men not afraid of God afraid of me."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Colley Cibber was a sharp thorn in Pope's side; he
was a witty actor, as well as clever dramatist and
mediocre poet. He was chosen poet-laureate in 1730.
His most popular comedy was "Love's Last Shift, or
the Fool in Fashion," though it divided the honors
with the "Careless Husband," in which Cibber himself
enacted the principal role. Dr. Johnson disliked
him because, "though he was not a blockhead, he
was pert, petulant, and presumptuous." On the stage
he excelled in almost the whole range of light, fantastic,
comic characters; but in poetry, which he much
affected, his lyrics were all so bad that his friends
pretended he made them so on purpose, and fully
justified Johnson's remark that they were "truly incomparable."
He was the recipient of a pension of
two hundred pounds from George I.</p>

<p>There is a vein of vanity in most of us: few authors
or artists are without a share; and, singular to say, it
most frequently arises from trivial matters in which
there would seem to be the least cause for pride.
William Mitford, the author of the "History of
Greece," a scholarly and admirable piece of literary
work, was most proud of his election to a captaincy
in the Southampton militia. To be sure, his literary
work challenged some severe criticism; De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Quincey said of it, "It is as nearly perfect in its
injustice as human infirmity will allow." Carlyle
certainly magnified his own calling when he wrote:
"O thou who art able to write a book, which once
in the two centuries or oftener there is a man gifted
to do, envy not him whom they name conqueror or
city-builder, and inexpressibly pity him whom they
name conqueror or city-burner." Great as he was
in authorship, Macaulay in one of his letters remarks,
"I never read again the most popular passages of
my own works without painfully feeling how far my
execution has fallen short of the standard which is
in my mind." He is undoubtedly one of the noblest
characters in English literature, and his mortal remains
very properly rest in the Poets' Corner of
Westminster Abbey,&mdash;a favorite resort of the great
historian during his life. As an example of modest
merit we recall the name of Robert Boyle, the Irish
chemist and linguist, the great experimental philosopher
of the seventeenth century,&mdash;he whom some
wit called "the father of chemistry and the brother
of the Earl of Cork." He translated the Gospels into
the Malay language, and published the translation at
his own expense; he was besides a thorough Hebrew
and Greek scholar. His many published works are
all profound and useful. He was chosen President of
the Royal Soceity, but refused the honor, from an
humble estimate of his own merit, and for the same
reason declined a peerage which was tendered to him.
We owe to him, according to Boerhaave, "the secrets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of fire, air, water, animals, plants, and fossils." Boyle
cared nothing for fame.</p>

<p>In realizing that genius is apt among its other
foibles to be over self-conscious, we should be careful
not to confound conceit with vanity, to which it is so
nearly allied. The latter makes one sensitive to the
opinions of others, while the former renders us self-satisfied.
Few have possessed either genius or personal
beauty without being conscious of it; though
Hazlitt declares that no great man ever thought himself
great,&mdash;an assertion which the reader will hardly
be prepared to indorse. A famous American philosopher
was persuaded that vanity was often the source
of good to the possessor, and that among other comforts
of life, one might consistently thank God for
his vanity. Still, when evinced in social intercourse
nothing is more derogatory to dignity; one becomes
not only his own, but everybody's fool. "Vanity is
so anchored in the heart of man," says Pascal, "that
a soldier, sutler, cook, and street porter vapor and wish
to have their admirers; and philosophers even wish
the same."</p>

<p>Concerning localities rendered of special interest
by association, Leigh Hunt said: "I can no more
pass through Westminster without thinking of Milton,
or the Borough without thinking of Chaucer
and Shakespeare, or Gray's Inn without calling Bacon
to mind, or Bloomsbury Square without Steele and
Akenside, than I can prefer bricks and mortar to
wit and poetry, or not see a beauty upon it beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
architecture, in the splendor of the recollection. I
once had duties to perform which kept me out late
at night, and severely taxed my health and spirits.
My path lay through a neighborhood in which Dryden
lived; and though nothing could be more commonplace,
and I used to be tired to the heart and soul of
me, I never hesitated to go a little out of the way,
purely that I might pass through Gold Street, to give
myself the shadow of a pleasant thought." Gibbon
was twenty-three years in preparing the material for
and in writing his "Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire;" that is to say, he began it in 1764, and did
not finish it until 1787. He says as he "sat musing
amidst the ruins of the capital, while the barefooted
friars were singing vespers in the temple of Jupiter,
the idea of writing the decline and fall of the city first
occurred to his mind." The writer of these pages has
visited the garden and summer-house at Lausanne,
overlooking Lake Leman, where Gibbon completed
his work, and where he laid down his pen in triumph
almost exactly a century since.</p>

<p>James Watt has localized a spot of interest in connection
with himself at Glasgow, where first flashed
upon him the idea which resulted in the improvement
of the steam-engine. Leibnitz recalls the grove near
Leipsic where in his youth he first began to meditate
and create. So Burns had his favorite walk at Dumfries,
secluded, and commanding a view of the distant
hills, where he composed, as was his wont, in the open
air. He says in a letter to Mr. Thomson, August,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
1793, "Autumn is my propitious season. I make more
verses in it than all the year else." Luther tells us
of the spot, and the very tree, under which he argued
with Dr. Staupitz as to whether it was his true
vocation to preach. Beethoven wrote to Frau von
Streicher, at Baden: "When you visit the ancient
ruins, do not forget that Beethoven has often lingered
there; when you stray through the silent pine forest,
do not forget that Beethoven often wrote poems there,
or, as it is termed, 'composed.'" How readily we
pardon the conceit that peeps out from the words of
the great magician of harmony! Hawthorne writes
in his note-book: "If ever I should have a biographer,
he ought to make great mention of this chamber in
my memoirs; because here my mind and character
were formed, and here I sat a long, long time, waiting
for the world to know me, and sometimes wondering
why it did not know me sooner, or whether it
would ever know me at all,&mdash;at least until I were
in my grave." Scott tells us of the precise spot where
at the age of thirteen he first read Percy's "Reliques
of Ancient English Poetry," beneath a huge platanus
tree, forgetting his dinner in the absorbing interest
of the book, whose influence upon the mind of the
youth may easily be traced in the future poet and
romancer. Cowper, who was not blessed with a particularly
good memory with regard to what he was
accustomed to read, yet possessed a tenacious one for
localities, and therefore used in summer to select
certain spots out of doors by pond or hedges where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to read his favorite books and chapters. The recalling
of these spots brought back, he said, the remembrance
of the subjects and chapters read beside them.
This was certainly an original and remarkable mode
of memorizing ideas. William Ellery Channing localizes
the clump of willows, a favorite retreat, where
the view of the dignity of human nature first broke
upon him, and of which he was ever after such a
tenacious advocate. He often resorted hither, and
speaks of the place with grateful solemnity. It overlooked
the meadows and river west of Boston, with
a background formed by the Brookline hills.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Washington
Irving used to point out to visitors the spot,
commanding the Hudson River, where he first read the
"Lady of the Lake," with a wild-cherry tree over his
head. In his old age he writes to a friend: "Come
and see me, and I will give you a book and a tree."</p>

<p>As an example of the perseverance of genius under
discouraging circumstances, we recall the trying experience
of our own great naturalist Audubon, who had
stored in a pine box a thousand and more of his drawings
for his great work on "The Birds of America,"
while he pursued his studies. On opening the box,
after the lapse of a few months, he found his carefully
made illustrations destroyed and converted into a nest
for rats. The work of years was irreparably gone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>to nought. After a brief period of bitter disappointment,
he says: "I took up my gun, my note-book,
and my pencil, and went forth to the woods as gayly
as if nothing had happened. I felt pleased that I
might now make better drawings than before; and,
ere a period not exceeding three years had elapsed,
my portfolio was again filled."<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The destruction of
his first thousand drawings was a blessing in disguise,
both to science and to its modest disciple, since
it confirmed him in the resolve which culminated in
producing what Cuvier denominated "the most magnificent
monument art had ever erected to ornithology."
The destruction of Sir Isaac Newton's papers
by his favorite dog, embracing the careful calculations
of years of study, will occur to the reader in
this connection, as well as the loss of Carlyle's first
manuscript copy of the "French Revolution," burned
by a maid-of-all-work to kindle the fire. Having no
draft or copy of the same, he was compelled to reproduce
it as nearly as possible from memory. There
is positive pleasure in the original production of a
piece of literary work; but the reproduction under
such circumstances must have been agonizing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>The history of literature is full of instances wherein
its votaries have by patient perseverance finally
achieved the much-desired fame which has inspired
them to endure deprivation and labor. We affirm
this, though at the same time recalling Douglas Jerrold's
words,&mdash;"How much of what is thought by
idle people fame is really sought for as the representative
of so many legs of mutton! We may make
Fame an angelic creature on the tombs of poets, but
how often do bards invoke her as a bouncing landlady!"
Pope made his way from obscurity, overcoming
by sheer perseverance obstacles that genius hardly
ever before encountered. He was not only deformed,
as we have said, but he was diseased, "unable to take
his own stockings off&mdash;a woman nurse with him always."
So far as we know it, there was not much to
love, or even respect, in his personal character; but
we must all admire the wonderful perseverance and
genius that enabled him to write what he did. His
translation of the Iliad alone was sufficient to give
him lasting fame; and it did give him plenty of
money, as he received a little over five thousand three
hundred pounds from it. How Goldsmith would have
scattered that generous sum of money, and how securely
Pope hoarded it!</p>

<p>Gifford showed wonderful perseverance and resolve
in the right direction, learning to write and to work
out mathematical sums on scraps of leather with an
awl, for the want of better facilities. This was at
his native place, Ashburton in Devonshire, where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
sat all day for five years upon a cobbler's bench,
earning just enough to support life. But he conquered
in the brave struggle with adverse fortune.
"The nerve that never relaxes, the eye that never
blenches, the thought that never wanders,&mdash;these
are the masters of victory," says Burke. Gifford
finally came to the editorial chair of the "Quarterly
Review," where he remained for fifteen years, proving
one of the severest critics of his day, as we have had
occasion to observe, and regarding authors, according
to Southey, as Izaak Walton did worms, slugs, and
frogs. "Whatever may have been his talents," says
Mr. Whipple, "they were exquisitely unfitted for his
position; his literary judgment being contemptible
where any sense of beauty was required."</p>

<p>As an example of calm, determined resolve and
patience to accomplish an honorable end, we know of
nothing more remarkable in connection with authorship
or literature than that of Sir Walter Scott's
deliberately sitting down to pay off a debt of one
hundred and twenty-eight thousand pounds with his
pen. Scott considered it a debt of honor, though
it was not of his own contracting. Amid the pains
and pressure of increasing age he worked on to fulfil
this honorable purpose, until in seven years he had
paid all but about twenty thousand pounds of this
enormous load of debt, when the overwrought brain
and body gave out, and he was laid to sleep forever.
The great "Wizard of the North" says modestly: "It
is with the deepest regret that I recollect in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
manhood the opportunities of learning<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> which I neglected
in my youth; through every part of my literary
career I have felt pinched and hampered by my own
ignorance, and I would at this moment give half the
reputation I have had the good fortune to acquire, if
by so doing I could rest the remaining part upon a
sound foundation of learning and science."</p>

<p class="large center p4">CHAPTER IX.</p>


<p>There seems always to have been a natural attraction
in literature which draws from other and less
captivating professions. Bryant, Longfellow, and
Washington Irving started early in life with the purpose
of studying law; so did Bailey the poet, and Prescott
the historian,&mdash;though each and all abandoned
that profession for literature. Beaconsfield served
an apprenticeship in an attorney's office in London.
Burke, Lockhart, John Wilson, Shirley Brooks, Corneille,
Layard, and Buffon began in life as solicitors,
but soon drifted into literature. Byron's first poetical
efforts were failures; so were those of Bulwer-Lytton
and Beaconsfield, both in literature and oratory. "I
have begun several times many things, and have succeeded
in them at last," said the latter when he was
hissed down in the House of Commons. "I shall sit
down now, but the time will come when you will hear
me." He toiled patiently, until the House laughed
with him instead of at him.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Sheridan broke down
completely on the occasion of his first effort at public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>speaking, but declared that it was in him and should
come out. Bulwer-Lytton worked his way upwards by
slow degrees, and acquired his later facility only by the
greatest assiduity and patient application. He wrote
at first very slowly and with great difficulty; but he
resolved to overcome his slowness of thought, and he
succeeded. He was very systematic in his literary
work, and rarely wrote more than three hours each
day; that is, from ten o'clock in the morning until one.
When regularly engaged, the product of a day in latter
years amounted to twenty pages of printed matter,
such as appear in the regular editions of his novels.
Jean Paul Richter's first efforts as a writer were
failures; but he possessed genius and the great element
of success,&mdash;namely, patience. He fought long and
hard to attain a position in literature, supporting himself
by small contributions to the press, not all of
which were accepted or paid for. "I will succeed in
making an honorable living by my pen," he said, "or
I will starve in the attempt." His triumph was near
at hand.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>It is the overcoming of difficulties by heroic perseverance
that in no small degree serves to secure and
to fix success. "Every noble work is at first impos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>sible,"
says Carlyle. "Even in social life it is persistency,"
says Whipple, "which attracts confidence,
more than talents and accomplishments."</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that the greatest geniuses have
not commanded success at the outset, but have finally
achieved it by deserving it. Voltaire was one of the
most brilliant and popular of dramatists; but when
"Mariamne" was brought out, it was played but once.
The question of its merit was settled oddly enough.
The farce which was given after Voltaire's production
was entitled "Mourning." "For the deceased play, I
suppose," said one of the critics, in the pit; and this
decided the fate of the piece. Again, when the
"Semirarmis" of Voltaire was acted for the first time,
it was far from receiving all the praise which its
author anticipated for it. As he was coming from
the theatre, he overtook Piron, a less celebrated but
brother dramatist, and asked him his opinion of the
piece. "I think," said Piron, "you would be very
glad if I had written it!"</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel Parr, whom Macaulay pronounced to be
the greatest scholar of his age, was a very hard-working
literary genius, sensitive more especially to the
tender emotions, so that he would weep like a woman
when listening to any affecting story. He was very
erratic and imaginative, having a special horror of
the east wind, which he believed had both a moral
and physical power over him. Sheridan knew this
very well, and kept the Doctor a prisoner in the house
for a whole fortnight by fixing the weathercock in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
that direction. The Doctor was not without his share
of conceit, founded upon the possession of acknowledged
talent and ability. He once said in a miscellaneous
assembly, pertinent to the subject before the
company: "England has produced three great classical
scholars: the first was Bentley, the second was
Porson, and the third modesty forbids <i>me</i> to mention."</p>

<p>In glancing through the records of the past no name
upon the roll of fame strikes the eye of appreciation
more pleasantly than that of Sir Philip Sidney, whose
life has been called poetry put in action. He lived
amid contemporary applause, and his memory is the
admiration of all. The bravest of soldiers, he was
also the gentlest of sons, equally illustrious for moral
qualities and for intellectual genius, controlled by
"that chastity of honor which felt a stain like a
wound." No incident in history is more familiar
than that of this exhausted warrior resigning the cup
of water to a fainting soldier, whose need, he said,
was greater than his own. Sidney was one of the
brightest ornaments of Queen Elizabeth's court.
Lord Brooke, who was his intimate friend, says of
him: "Though I lived with him and knew him from
a child, yet I never knew him other than a man with
such steadiness of mind, lovely and familiar gravity,
as carried grace and reverence above greater years.
His talk was ever of knowledge, and his very play
tended to enrich the mind." His death occurred at
the age of thirty-two, from a wound in battle, the
result of his self-abnegation. He was in full armor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
but seeing the marshal of the camp unprotected, he
took off his armor and gave it to him, thus exposing
himself to the mortal wound which he received.
Fuller says, "He was slain before Zutphen, in a small
skirmish which we may sadly term a great battle,
considering our heavy loss therein."</p>

<p>Victor Hugo was banished from France for his opposition
to the <i>coup d'état</i>. He was ever true to his
convictions without counting the cost. "If there is
anything grander than Victor Hugo's genius," said
Louis Blanc, "it is the use which he has made of it."
He affords us an instance of the highest fame and the
favor of fortune culminating in ripe old age. When
Hugo was but a rising man, he was still looked upon
by the elder littérateurs with considerable jealousy.
At the time when he was first an aspirant for the
honors of the French Academy, and called on M.
Royer-Collard to solicit his vote, the sturdy veteran
professed entire ignorance of his name. "I am the
author of 'Notre Dame de Paris,' 'Marion Delorme,'
'Les Derniers Jours d'un Condamne,' etc." "I never
heard of them," said Collard. "Will you do me the
honor of accepting a copy of my works?" said Victor
Hugo, with perfect urbanity. "I never read new
books," was the cutting reply.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> But the time came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>presently when not to know the author of "Les
Misérables" was to argue one's self unknown. When
he had reached the age of sixty-three he wrote on
a bit of sketching paper accompanying a scene he
wished to delineate in the "Toilers of the Sea:"
"On the face of this cardboard I have sketched my
own destiny,&mdash;a steamboat tossed by the tempest
in the midst of the monstrous ocean; almost disabled,
assaulted by foaming waves, and having nothing
left but a bit of smoke which people call glory,
which the wind sweeps away, and which constitutes
its strength."</p>

<p>Improvidence has ever been a distinctive and a
common feature in the lives of men of genius. Sir
Thomas Lawrence, the celebrated English portrait-painter,
was an illustrious example. Of his natural
genius there was ample evidence even in childhood,
when at the age of six years he produced in crayon
in a very few moments accurate likenesses of eminent
persons. At the age of twenty-three he succeeded
Sir Joshua Reynolds as first painter to the king.
He received a hundred guineas each for his portraits,&mdash;head
and bust,&mdash;and one thousand if full-length,
which was a large price for those days;
and yet he was always embarrassed for money, and
died deeply in debt while president of the Royal
Academy.</p>

<p>Thomas Moore was very improvident; and though
he realized over thirty thousand pounds from his
literary productions, yet his family were obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
live in the most economical manner, often experiencing
serious deprivation of the ordinary comforts of
life. "His excellent wife," says Rogers, "contrived
to maintain the whole family upon a guinea a week;
and he, when in London, thought nothing of throwing
away that sum weekly on hackney-coaches and
gloves." In order to escape the payment of his just
debts, Moore was finally obliged to go to Paris, where,
Rogers tells us, he frittered away a thousand pounds
a year.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>Lamartine and the elder Dumas are notable examples
of gross improvidence,&mdash;the first being reduced
almost to beggary before his death, and supported
solely by the liberal contributions of his admirers,
while the latter was much of his life either squandering
gold profusely or dodging his honest creditors.</p>

<p>Richard Savage, the unfortunate poet and dramatist,
passed his life divided between beggary and extravagance.
His undoubted genius and ability as an
author attracted the hearty friendship of Johnson and
Steele, both of whom made earnest efforts to save him
from himself; but dissolute habits had taken too firm
a hold of him. It is also honorable to Pope that he
was his steady and consistent friend almost to the
close of his life. Savage's ill-conceived poem of
"The Bastard" was intended to expose the cruelty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>of his mother, who was responsible in the main for
the wreck of his life. He finally died a prisoner for
debt in Bristol jail. Undoubtedly Dr. Johnson was
right when he said that the miseries which Savage
underwent were sometimes the consequence of his
faults, and his faults were often the effect of his
misfortunes.</p>

<p>The period of which we are writing has been vividly
described by Macaulay, from whom we quote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"All that is squalid and miserable might now be summed
up in the word Poet. That word denoted a creature dressed
like a scarecrow, familiar with compters and sponging-houses,
and perfectly competent to decide on the comparative merits
of the Common Side in the King's Bench prison and of
Mount Scoundrel in the Fleet. Even the poorest pitied
him; and they well might pity him. For if their condition
was equally abject, their aspirings were not equally high,
nor their sense of insult equally acute. To lodge in a
garret up four pair of stairs, to dine in a cellar among footmen
out of place, to translate ten hours a day for the wages
of a ditcher, to be hunted by bailiffs from one haunt of beggary
and pestilence to another,&mdash;from Grub Street to St.
George's Field, and from St. George's Field to the alleys
behind St. Martin's church,&mdash;to sleep on a bulk in June
and amidst the ashes of a glass-house in December, to die
in a hospital and to be buried in a parish vault, was the
fate of more than one writer who, if he had lived thirty
years earlier, would have been admitted to the sittings of
the Kitcat or the Scriblerus club, would have sat in Parliament,
and would have been intrusted with embassies to the
High Allies; who, if he had lived in our time, would have
found encouragement scarcely less munificent in Albemarle
Street or in Paternoster Row.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>
<p>"As every climate has its peculiar diseases, so every walk
of life has its peculiar temptations. The literary character
assuredly has always had its share of faults, vanity, jealousy,
morbid sensibility. To these faults were now superadded
the faults which are commonly found in men whose livelihood
is precarious, and whose principles are exposed to the
trial of severe distress. All the vices of the gambler and
of the beggar were blended with those of the author. The
prizes in the wretched lottery of book-making were scarcely
less ruinous than the blanks. If good fortune came, it came
in such a manner that it was almost certain to be abused.
After a month of starvation and despair, a full third night
or a well-received dedication filled the pocket of the lean,
ragged, unwashed poet with guineas. He hastened to enjoy
those luxuries with the images of which his mind had
been haunted while he was sleeping amidst the cinders and
eating potatoes at the Irish ordinary in Shoe Lane. A
week of taverns soon qualified him for another year of
night-cellars. Such was the life of Savage, of Boyse, and
of a crowd of others. Sometimes blazing in gold-lace hats
and waistcoats; sometimes lying in bed because their coats
had gone to pieces, or wearing paper cravats because their
linen was in pawn; sometimes drinking champagne and
Tokay with Betty Careless; sometimes standing at the
window of an eating-house in Porridge island, to snuff up
the scent of what they could not afford to taste,&mdash;they
knew luxury; they knew beggary; but they never knew
comfort. These men were irreclaimable. They looked on
a regular and frugal life with the same aversion which
an old gypsy or a Mohawk hunter feels for a stationary
abode, and for the restraints and securities of civilized
communities."</p></blockquote>

<p>Notwithstanding Douglas Jerrold received a thousand
pounds per annum from "Lloyd's Weekly News<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>paper"
alone, besides a respectable income from
"Punch" and other literary labor, he never had a
guinea in his pocket; every penny was forestalled,
and he left his family in extreme penury.</p>

<p>Goldsmith, as we have seen, was the most improvident
of men, and died owing two thousand pounds;
which led Dr. Johnson to say, "Was ever poet so
trusted before?" It was at this time that Boswell,
who was always a little jealous of Goldsmith's intimacy
with Johnson, made some disparaging remarks
about the dead poet; whereupon Johnson promptly
replied, "Dr. Goldsmith was wild, sir, but he is so no
more!" "Cover the good man who has been vanquished,"
says Thackeray,&mdash;"cover his face and pass
on!" Some families seem to inherit impecuniosity;
Goldsmith came thus rightfully, so to speak, by his
weakness in this respect.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>Sheridan, according to Byron, wrote the best
comedy, the "School for Scandal;" the best opera,
the "Duenna;" the best farce, the "Critic;" and
delivered the most famous oration of modern times.
With genius and talents which entitled him to the
highest station, he yet sank into difficulties, mostly
through inexcusable improvidence, outraging every
principle of justice and of truth, finally dying in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>neglect. The reader will be apt to recall the anecdote
illustrative of Sheridan's impecuniosity. As he
was hacking his face one day with a dull razor, he
turned to his son and said, "Tom, if you open any
more oysters with my razor, I'll cut you off with a
shilling." "Very well, father," was the reply; "but
where is the shilling to come from?" Sheridan
thought if he had stuck to the law he might have
done as well as his friend Erskine; "but," he added,
"I had no time for such studies; Mrs. Sheridan and
myself were often obliged to keep writing for our
daily leg or shoulder of mutton, otherwise we should
have had no dinner; yes, it was a <i>joint</i> concern."</p>

<p>All authorities combine in pronouncing the great
speech of Sheridan on the impeachment of Warren
Hastings to be one of the grandest oratorical efforts
known to us. But the persuasive power of eloquence
was never better illustrated than in the instance of
Mirabeau when he pleaded his own case. His liaison
with the Marchioness de Mounier surpasses, in fact,
all stories of romance. Mirabeau induced her to run
away with him, for which she was seized and thrown
into a convent, while he escaped to Switzerland.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> He
was brought to trial, was convicted of contumacy,
and sentenced to lose his head. The lady escaped
and once more joined him; together they passed into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>Holland, where they were a second time arrested, she
being again immured in a convent and he confined
in the Castle of Vincennes, where he remained for
more than three years. After his liberation he obtained
a new trial, pleaded his own case, and by the
impassioned power of his all-commanding eloquence
he terrified the court and the prosecutor, melted the
audience to tears, obtained a prompt reversal of his
sentence, and even threw the whole cost of the suit
upon the prosecution.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>When the stupid, ill-bred Judge Robinson insulted
Curran by reflecting upon his poverty while he was
arguing a case before him, saying to him that he
"suspected his law library was rather contracted,"
Curran answered the servile office-holder in words
of aptest eloquence and cutting irony. "It is true,
my lord," said Curran, with dignified respect, "that
I am poor, and the circumstance has somewhat curtailed
my library; my books are not numerous,
but they are select, and I hope they have been
perused with proper disposition. I have prepared
myself for this high profession rather by the study
of a few good works than by the composition of a
great many bad ones. I am not ashamed of my
poverty, but I should be ashamed of my wealth could
I have stooped to acquire it by servility and corruption.
If I rise not to rank, I shall at least be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>honest; and should I ever cease to be so, many an
example shows me that ill-gained reputation, by making
me the more conspicuous, would only make me
the more universally and the more notoriously contemptible!"<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Speaking of eloquence, Hazlitt describes how he
walked ten miles to hear Coleridge the poet preach,
and declared that he could not have been more delighted
if he had heard the music of the spheres.
The names of Fox, Pitt, Grattan, Patrick Henry,
Daniel Webster, Wendell Phillips, and Rufus Choate,
with many others, crowd upon the mind as we dwell
upon the theme of eloquence in oratory. There is
eloquence of the pen as well as of the tongue;
Socrates of old, celebrated for his noble oratorical
compositions, was of so timid a disposition that he
rarely ventured to speak in public. He compared
himself to a whetstone, which will not cut, but which
readily enables other things to do so; for his productions
served as models to other orators.</p>

<p>We have myriads of examples showing us that
accident has often determined the bent and development
of genius. Accident may not, however, create
genius; it is innate, or it is not at all. Cowley tells
us that when quite young he chanced upon a copy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>the "Faerie Queene,"<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> nearly the only book at hand,
and becoming interested he read it carefully and
often, until enchanted thereby he became irrevocably
a poet. The apple that fell on Newton's head with
a force apparently out of all proportion to its size,
led him to ponder upon the fact, until he deduced the
great law of gravitation and laid the foundation of
his philosophy. It was Shakespeare's youthful roguery
which drove him from his trade of wool-carding and
necessitated his leaving Stratford. A company of
strolling actors became his first new associates, and
he took up with their business for a while; but dissatisfied
with his own success as an actor he turned
to writing plays, and thus arose the greatest dramatist
the world has produced. Molière, who was of
very low birth, being often taken as a lad to the
theatre by his grandfather, was thus led to study the
usages of the stage, and came to be the greatest
dramatic author of France. "Tartuffe," which he
wrote a hundred and twenty years ago, still holds
the stage, as well as many others of his inimitable
productions. He was the Shakespeare of France.
Hallam says that Shakespeare had the greater genius,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>but Molière has perhaps written the better comedies.
Corneille fell in love, and was thus incited to pour
out his feelings in verse, developing rapidly into a
poet and dramatist. He was intended for the law;
but love tripped up his heels and made him a
poet.</p>

<p>The chance perusal of De Foe's "Essay on Projects,"
Dr. Franklin tells us, influenced the principal events
and course of his life; so the reading of the "Lives of
the Saints" caused Ignatius Loyola to form the purpose
of creating a new religious order,&mdash;which purpose
eventuated in the powerful society of the Jesuits.
Benjamin West says, "A kiss from my mother made
me a painter."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> La Fontaine read by chance a volume
of Malherbe's poems,&mdash;he who was called "the poet of
princes and the prince of poets,"&mdash;whereby he became
so impressed, that ever after his mind sought expression
through the same medium. Rousseau's eccentric
genius was first aroused by an advertisement offering
a prize for the best essay on a certain theme, which
brought out his "Declamation against the Arts and
Sciences" (winning the prize thereby), and determined
his future career. The husband and father of
the woman who nursed Michael Angelo were stone-masons,
and the chisel thus became the first and most
common plaything put into the child's hands; hence
his earliest efforts were made to apply the hammer
and chisel to marble, and the seed was planted which
blossomed into art. It was the accidental observation
of steam, lifting by its expansive power the heavy
iron cover of a boiling pot, that suggested to the mind
of James Watt thoughts which led to the invention of
the steam-engine. The "Pickwick Papers," Dickens's
earliest and best literary work, owes its origin to
the publisher of a magazine upon which he was
doing job-work desiring him to write a serial story
to fit some comic pictures which were in the publisher's
possession. The genius was in Dickens, but
it slept.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<p>The sight of Virgil's tomb, just above the Grotto of
Posilippo, at Naples, determined Giovanni's literary
vocation for life. So Gibbon was struck with the idea
of writing his "Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire,"
as he sat dreaming amid the ruins of the Forum.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
When Scott was a mere boy he chanced upon a copy
of Percy's "Reliques of Ancient Poetry," which he
read with eagerness again and again. As soon as he
could get the necessary sum of money, he purchased
a copy; and thus the taste for poetry was early instilled
into his soul and found after expression in his charming
poems. Scott's first literary effort was the translation
of "Götz von Berlichengen," to which Carlyle
ascribes large influence on the great novelist's future
career. He says this translation was "the prime cause
of 'Marmion' and the 'Lady of the Lake,' with all
that has followed from the same creative hand. Truly
a grain of seed that had lighted in the right soil. For
if not firmer and fairer, it has grown to be taller and
broader than any other tree; and all nations of the
earth are still yearly gathering of its fruit."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>
<p>While in England, not long since, the writer of these
pages was told an anecdote relating to Mrs. Siddons
which was new to him, and which illustrates how often
accident has directed the future bent of genius. When
quite a young lady, Sarah Siddons saw in some private
gallery an antique statue of great excellence, which
had a most electrifying effect upon her. It suggested
to her at once the most effective position and manner in
which to express intensity of feeling. The arms were
close down at the sides, and the hands nervously
clenched, while the head was erect, the chest expanded,
and the face half in profile. "I cannot express how
indelibly the pose took effect upon my imagination,"
said the great actress many years afterwards, "or the
force of the lesson taught me by the marble." If
memory serves us correctly, we recall an old engraving
of Mrs. Siddons in the character of Lady Macbeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
which would be nearly a reproduction of the pose
described.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p>Accident developed one of the greatest vocalists
the world has ever known. Jenny Lind was at the
beginning of her life a poor neglected little girl,
homely and uncouth, living in a single room of a
tumble-down house in a narrow street at Stockholm.
When the humble woman who had her in charge went
out to her daily labor, she was accustomed to lock
Jenny in with her sole companion, a cat. One day
the little girl, who was always singing to herself like
a canary-bird, "because," as she said, "the song was
in her and would come out," sat with her dumb companion
at the window warbling her sweet childlike
notes. She was overheard by a passing lady, who
paused and listened, struck by the clearness and trill
of the untutored notes. She made careful inquiries
about the child and became the patroness of little
Jenny, who was at once supplied with a music-teacher.
She loved the art of song, and had the true genius
for it. Jenny made rapid progress, surprising both
patroness and teachers, and presently became the
great Queen of Song.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p>The world knows of Jenny Lind's splendid fortune,
of her professional triumphs, and of her noble charities;
but few, perhaps, have ever pictured her humble girlhood,
cooped up in a cheerless room, with only her cat
for a companion, in a dull quarter of the Swedish
capital. The plain, awkward girl grew up under
favorable culture to be a graceful, lovely woman. The
courts of Europe treated her as a revered guest; she
was covered with laurels and with jewels, but she was
ever in disposition and character the same pure,
simple Swedish girl. Adulation had no power to spoil
this child of Nature and of art. The Swedish public
cherish her name as that of their most favored
daughter, and honor her for the noble educational
institution which she has so liberally founded in her
native Stockholm.</p>

<p>Christina Nilsson, another Scandinavian vocalist,
was the daughter of an humble Swedish peasant, born
in so lowly a cabin that it was difficult to conceive of
the name of "home" being applied to it. While yet a
child she was obliged to work with the rest of the
family in the fields and on the mountain-side. Her
sweet voice was first heard at the fairs and peasant
weddings, where her simple Scandinavian melodies
delighted the assembled crowds. At one of these
public gatherings a man of taste and means heard
the child's voice, and realized the hidden possibilities
it indicated. He was a magistrate, and became her
patron, taking her from her humble surroundings and
supplying her with suitable teachers. She was care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>fully
taught instrumental as well as vocal music, and
became both an eminent pianist and singer, developing
like her fair countrywoman, Jenny Lind, into a
vocalist of grandest genius, and of such ability as the
world affords but few examples.</p>

<p>Taglioni was also Scandinavian by birth, having
been born at Stockholm, in 1804, of humble parentage,
her father being a dancing-master. She had the
genius of an artist, which she patiently developed
through many dark hours of toil and deprivation,
until she made herself acknowledged as queen of the
ballet in the great cities of Europe. Her purity of
character added a charm to her public performances,
giving her a prestige never before enjoyed by any exponent
of her art. She finally amassed a large fortune,
and retiring from the stage married Count Gilbert
de Voisins. Doubtless many of our readers have
paused in their gondolas beneath the windows of her
marble palace on the Grand Canal at Venice, to recall
the story of the great danseuse, or have looked
with pleasure upon her elegant villa on the Lake of
Como.</p>

<p class="large center p4">CHAPTER X.</p>


<p>It is not the author's purpose to treat the names of
painters, or indeed those of any other branch of art,
especially by themselves. Were any single line to be
selected, the peculiarities of its representatives would
alone be sufficient to fill a volume. Under the general
design of this gossip about genius, the pen is
permitted to glide after its own fancy, treating only
upon such individuals as readily suggest themselves,
and who are illustrative of characteristics already
introduced.</p>

<p>Upon beginning the chapter before us, we were
thinking of John Opie, the distinguished English
painter, born in Cornwall in 1761. When Opie was
only ten years of age<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> he saw a person who was somewhat
accomplished with the pencil draw a butterfly.
The boy watched the process with marked interest,
and as soon as the draughtsman had departed, produced
upon a shingle a drawing equally good, which he
showed to his mother. She, good woman, encouraged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>him, as Mrs. West did her son on a similar occasion;
but the father, being a harsh, rude, low-bred man,
was constantly punishing the boy for laziness, and
for chalking figures, faces, and animals on every
stray bit of board or flat surface at hand. The boy
had genius, however; what he required was opportunity.
Good fortune sent Dr. Wolcott, better known
as "Peter Pindar," that way. He saw the boy's
dawning genius, and helped him with suitable material
and some useful suggestions. It was not long before
the lad got away from home, quietly aided by his
good friend Wolcott, and soon earned money enough
to clothe himself decently and to make a start in life.
He finally married Amelia, daughter of James Alderson,
who afterwards became the well-known authoress
Amelia Opie. The husband developed into a distinguished
artist, whose historical pictures, "The Death of
Rizzio" and "Jephthah's Vow," were stepping-stones
to his election as President of the Royal Academy.
Does not this truthful sketch from life, of a poor wood-sawyer's
son, read like romance?</p>

<p>Genius will assert itself; it seems useless to strive
against it. The secret suggestions of the soul are
true, lead us whither they will. Salvator Rosa was
the son of a poor architect who made ineffectual
efforts to thwart his son's predilection for art, but all
in vain. The young man, finding that he could not
hope for any assistance from his father, strove all the
harder to earn a livelihood by painting, but nearly
starved before he reached his majority. About this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
time the patrons of art in Rome offered a grand prize
for the best painting to be submitted at an exhibition
to be held in the Eternal City. The young Neapolitan
saw his chance, and painted a picture into which he
infused all the glowing spirit of the art which burned
within him. If it failed, he resolved that no one should
know aught of its authorship. It was forwarded
anonymously, and received the recognition of being
hung in the most favorable position. That picture
took the grand prize, the unknown artist being lauded
as above Titian. Nought was to be heard for it but
praise. This decided the fate of Rosa. He left his
humble home near Naples and settled in Rome, where
he secured the friendship and intimacy of the greatest
men of the day.</p>

<p>Numerous and grand were the pictures sent forth
from Rosa's hand; orders pressed upon him faster
than he could fill them, and thus he stepped at once
into the highest contemporary fame and fortune.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
"Salvator possessed real genius," says Ruskin, "but
was crushed by misery in his youth." He was not only
a painter, but also a poet and a musician; nearly all
cultured Italians are the latter. At the grand Carnival
of the year 1639 there appeared upon the Corso
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>and in the squares of Rome an actor of fantastic dress,
who was marked like all the other revellers on such
occasions, but whose name was given as one Formica,
of Southern Italy. He attracted both public and private
attention by his brilliant wit, his eloquence, and
especially by his songs, as he accompanied himself on
the lute. He was the hero of the Carnival of that
season. By and by the appointed hour arrived when
all the revellers unmasked, and lo! the stranger
proved to be Salvator Rosa.</p>

<p>Among painters, Rubens is one of the greatest and
most familiar names, though Ruskin disparages him
by saying that "he is a healthy, worthy, kind-hearted,
courtly-phrased animal, without any clearly perceptible
traces of a soul, except when he paints children."
Rubens became an artist from love of art, and his
career was one in which there was far more of sunshine
than usually falls to the lot of genius. He throve
greatly in a business point of view as well as in art,
and became a man of wealth in his native city of
Antwerp, where he built a comfortable house and
adorned it inside with pencil and brush&mdash;the whole,
as he estimated it, worth about a thousand pounds sterling.
Presently there came to Antwerp the Duke of
Buckingham, who coveted the artist's house. A negotiation
was opened, and Rubens sold it to the Duke
for twelve times what it cost, or say in our currency
sixty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Rubens must have possessed wonderful industry, as
we judge by the fact that a hundred of his paintings may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
be found in the Munich Gallery alone, not to mention
those contained in other European collections. Undoubtedly
his "Descent from the Cross," now in the
Antwerp Cathedral, is his grandest work. Our artist
was by no means without his vein of vanity, as evinced
by the family picture which he painted, and in which
he gives himself due prominence. This picture is
placed just above his tomb, back of the altar, in the
Church of St. Jacques, at Antwerp. The presumptuousness
is increased by the fact that the combined
portraits of his first and second wife, his daughter,
with his father, grandfather, and himself, are intended
to represent a Holy Family, and the painting is typical
of that idea. The whole is incongruous and in
bad taste. Vandyke, Teniers, and Denis Calvart, the
instructor of Guido Reni, were all natives of Antwerp.
The city owes its attraction to travellers almost solely
to the fact that here are so many masterpieces of
painting.</p>

<p>William Hogarth was a great and original genius,
who wrote comedies pictorially, satirized vice, and depicted
all phases of life more in detail than is possible
with the pen. He was early apprenticed to a silversmith;
but the natural bent of his genius was too
apparent and promising not to be encouraged by the
study of art. In the dramatic and satirical departments
of design he has never been excelled. It has
been objected that his pictures are vulgar; but when
we remember the period in which they appeared, and
also the fact that they undoubtedly convey useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
lessons of morality, we shall find ample excuse if not
commendation for the artist. In 1753 he published
his "Analysis of Beauty," in which he maintains that
a waving line is essential to beauty. Hogarth composed
comedies just as much as did Molière. It was
a singular characteristic of this able designer and
artist that he could not successfully illustrate another's
work; he is known utterly to have failed in the attempt,
though never in the successful illustration of
his own ideas. Hogarth was also a historian, inasmuch
as every picture he produced represented the
manners and customs of the period. The interior
scenes give us the exact style of the furniture and
minutest domestic surroundings; while out of doors
we have all the various modes of conveyance in use,
and a faithful picture of the street architecture.
Hogarth died in 1764.</p>

<p>James Spencer, who was a personal friend of Hogarth,
began life as a London footman; but the genius
of an artist was born in him, and it gradually forced
its way to the front. At odd moments he practised
drawing and even painting with oils, whenever and
wherever he could seize upon a brief chance. It
happened that a professional portrait-painter was engaged
to make a portrait of the head of the family
where Spencer had long acted as footman. When
the likeness was finished, he heard his master express
some just dissatisfaction at its want of resemblance
to the original. Spencer very humbly asked
permission of his master to copy the painting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
see if he could not get a good likeness. After expressing
some astonishment at the request, his master
assented. In a much briefer period than the first
artist occupied, and without a single sitting on the
part of his employer, Spencer astonished the family
by producing not only a remarkable likeness, but an
entirely satisfactory painting. With such a start the
footman became a professional portrait-painter, and
accumulated the means ere long to set up a fine
London establishment.</p>

<p>In an earlier part of this volume we gave numerous
instances of genius being at its best in early youth,
when, as Burke says, "the senses are unworn and
tender, and the whole frame is awake in every part."
Of this early development we know of no more striking
instance in art than that of Sir Thomas Lawrence,
who at the age of ten years surpassed most of the
London portrait-painters both in his certain likenesses
and in the general effect of his portraits. He
was a remarkable genius, and for a considerable period
was the talk of all London.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Added to his ability as
an artist, young Lawrence was remarkably handsome.
Prince Hoare saw something so angelic in his face
that he desired to paint him in the character of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>Christ. In about seven minutes Lawrence scarcely
ever failed of producing in crayon an excellent likeness
of any person present, and in a manner expressive of
both grace and freedom. He succeeded Sir Joshua
Reynolds, in due time, as first painter to the king,
was knighted in 1815, and five years later became
President of the Royal Academy.</p>

<p>To realize under what shadows many an artist
has lived, worked, and died, yet who is known to us
of the highest genius, we have only to recall some
familiar names. Correggio was of very humble birth:
and though one of the most original of all the brilliant
masters of the sixteenth century, he enjoyed
little contemporary fame. His works to-day are held
at as high a valuation as those of Raphael, Titian, or
Murillo.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> His modesty was characteristic; his pretension,
nothing. His pictures speak for him, and
exhibit the softness, tenderness, and harmony of his
nature. Nearly all his work was done at his native
city of Correggio and at Parma; nor is he believed
ever to have visited Rome. It was he who, after
gazing on one of Raphael's finest productions, exclaimed,
"I also am a painter!"</p>

<p>Correggio was chosen by the canons of the cathedral
at Parma to paint for them the "Assumption of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>the Virgin." It was a subject well fitted to his style,
and his conception and execution of the painting were
beyond criticism. It may be seen, mellowed by age,
in the Parma Cathedral to-day. When the work was
done, the priests meanly haggled and found fault with
it, in order to reduce the price, which had been previously
agreed upon. Finally, they only paid the artist
half the promised sum, stealing the balance to supply
their secret luxuries. To add insult to their meanness,
the priests paid the artist the price in copper
coin. He could not refuse the money, for his poverty-stricken
family awaited his return with it to supply
their pressing needs. Correggio took the heavy burden
on his shoulders and bore it two leagues and
more, under a broiling Italian sun, to reach his home.
On arriving there he was completely exhausted, and
drank freely of the water his children brought to
him; then, disheartened at his ill-fortune and broken
down by fatigue, he went sadly to his rude bed,
to awake on the following morning in a burning
fever and delirious. In two days Correggio was
no more.</p>

<p>The development of the genius which slept in the
soul of Canova when a lad was brought about by a
happy accident. A superb banquet was preparing in
the palace of the Falieri family at Venice. The tables
were already arranged, when it was discovered that
a crowning ornament of some sort was required to
complete the general effect of the banqueting board.
Canova's grandfather, who brought him up, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
stone-cutter, often hewing out stone ornaments for
the architects; and as he lived close at hand, he was
hastily consulted by the steward of the Falieris.
Canova chanced to go with his grandfather to view
the tables, and overheard the consultation. His quick
eye and ready genius at once suggested a suitable design
for the apex of the principal dishes. "Give me
a plate of cold butter," said the boy; and seating himself
at a side table he rapidly moulded a lion of proper
proportions, and so true to nature in its pose and
detail as to astonish all present. It was put in place,
and proved to be the most striking ornamental article
there. When the guests were seated and discovered
it, they exclaimed aloud with admiration,
and demanded to see at once the person who could
perform such a miracle impromptu. Canova was
brought before them, and his boyish person only
heightened their wonder. From that hour he had
in the head of this opulent family a kind, appreciative,
and liberal patron. He was placed under
tuition with the best sculptors of Venice and Rome,
to study the art of which he finally became a grand
master.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>The story of Spagnoletto is a romantic one, and not
without a vivid moral. Of such humble birth was he,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>that nothing is said of it by himself or his friends.
He suffered the very extreme of poverty; but feeling
a deep love for art, and a consciousness within him
that he was born to be a painter, he pursued this purpose
through besetting difficulties for years. He still
felt within him a power of genius superior to all and
every disadvantage which he encountered. He was
Spanish by birth, but made his way on foot to Rome,
where he worked for his daily bread at anything
which offered, and for many months was employed
as a street porter, but at the same time followed the
study of art in his humble way. One day a cardinal
passing in his carriage saw in the streets a ragged person
painting a board affixed to an ordinary house of
Rome. The young man's wretchedness attracted his
attention. It was Spagnoletto earning wherewith to
purchase a loaf of bread. The cardinal questioned
him, took him home to his palace and gave him every
luxury he desired, as well as the means to pursue
his beloved art. For a brief time all was well, and
the art student made great progress; but, alas! the
nature which could withstand the frowns of fortune
wilted beneath her smiles, and pleasure thoroughly
seduced the youth by her tempting wiles. He became
a slave to the senses, neglected art entirely, and was
fast going to ruin. One night Spagnoletto had a
dream; it was the midnight visit of his better angel,
and she prevailed. He awoke the next morning determined
to leave the cardinal's palace with all its
luxuries behind him, to resume his former condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and industry. He worked his way to Naples, and by
degrees rose steadily in art until he cast off his rags
and was independent. He furnished so perfect a
painting of Saint Bartholomew stripped to the muscles,
that it became a valued study for anatomists, and from
that day his fame was assured. His pictures were
eagerly sought for, and to-day they adorn the best
European galleries.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> As Salvator Rosa, the Italian
artist, delighted most in depicting wild, rugged mountain
scenery and battles, so Spagnoletto, the Spanish
painter, was most at home with martyrdoms, executions,
and tragic scenes generally. He died at Naples
in 1656.</p>

<p>Genius is confined to no line of art, to no special
profession; we find its exponents in the legislative
hall, in the pulpit, and on the stage. Garrick was
undoubtedly one of the greatest geniuses of the English
stage; he was not only an actor, but a successful
dramatic author. He married a Viennese danseuse,
and so far as the world knows was happy in his domestic
relations. He was equally at home in tragedy
and comedy, possessing in a most marvellous degree
the art of imitating the physiognomy of others and
the manner of expressing their various emotions. It
is said of him that he could imitate anything, bird
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>or beast, both in voice and manner. On the occasion
of a grand dinner-party in London, at a certain lord's,
Garrick was a guest; in the course of the entertainment
he was suddenly missed, and at last was discovered
in the garden belonging to the house, where a
young negro boy was rolling on the ground convulsed
with screams of laughter to see Garrick mimicking a
turkey-cock that was strutting about in the enclosure.
The actor had his coat-tail stuck out behind, and was in
a seeming flutter of feathered rage and pride.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Garrick
declared that he would cheerfully give a hundred
guineas if he could say "Oh!" as Whitfield did. A
noble friend wished him to be a candidate for Parliament.
"No, my lord," said the actor, sincerely; "I
would rather play the part of great men on the stage,
than the part of fool in Parliament."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> He accumulated
a large fortune, stated at over a hundred and fifty
thousand pounds. He died in 1779, and was buried
with such pomp as is awarded only to those who are
considered national characters. His ashes rest beside
the tomb of Shakespeare in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p><p>Moore mentions having seen that excellent comic
genius John Liston behind the scenes in a towering
rage about some trifle, while he was dressed and
"made up" for the part of Rigdum Funidos,&mdash;a contrast
which must have been as ludicrous as when
Washington Irving met Grimaldi in a furious rage
behind the curtain, with the regular stage grin painted
on his cheeks. Liston began his profession in tragic
parts and developed his wonderful comic powers by
chance, being suddenly called upon one evening to
fill the low comedian's place on account of the illness
of the actor cast for the part. He made a hit at once,
such as he had not dreamed of, and it was seen by
every one that he was naturally a comic actor. On
the occasion referred to, by the exercise of his extraordinary
facial powers he caused the spectators and
actors, until the curtain fell on the closing scene, to
roar with laughter, though but very little of the text
had been audible to them. True genius loses itself in
the character and the subject. Betterton, when he
performed Hamlet, by reason of the violent and sudden
emotion of amazement and horror at the presence
of his father's spectre, absolutely turned as white as
his neckcloth, although his natural cast of countenance
was very florid, while his whole body seemed affected
by an uncontrollable tremor. Had his father's apparition
indeed risen before him, he could not have been
seized with more real agonies. When a well-known
actor of that period, named Booth, first took the part of
the ghost, Betterton acted Hamlet; on which occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
his extraordinary look struck Booth with such horror
that for a moment he remained silent, having forgotten
his part.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>Samuel Foote, the witty English comedian, was one
of the vainest of geniuses. "For loud, obstreperous,
broad-faced mirth," said Dr. Johnson, "I know not
his equal." Foote sought the stage to earn thereby
a living after squandering his fortune at gaming and
other vices. When visiting in the country, his vanity
led him to boast of his horsemanship, an accomplishment
of which he knew little or nothing; and when invited
by Lord Mexborough to join the hunt, he could
not decently decline. The consequence was that at the
first burst he was thrown and broke his leg in two
places, so that amputation was necessary. However,
he managed to play nearly as well with a cork leg.
To some one who made a reflection upon his "game"
leg, Foote replied promptly: "Make no allusion to
my weakest part. Did I ever attack your head?"
Garrick, observing that Foote had placed a plaster bust
of him in his entry, remarked, "You are not afraid,
I see, to trust me near your gold and bank-notes."
"No," retorted the humorist, "you have no hands!"
Foote was considered by his contemporaries the greatest
master of comic humor after Molière. One day Foote,
Garrick, and Dr. Johnson went together to Bedlam,&mdash;a
hospital in London for the insane. Johnson, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>was much affected at the sight of so much human misery,
got into a corner by himself to meditate, and in
the progress of his mood he threw himself into so many
strange attitudes, and drew his face into such odd
shapes, that Foote whispered mysteriously to Garrick
to ask <i>how they should contrive to get him out</i>!</p>

<p>Of the moral character of Nell Gwynn, who was a
favorite London actress and a mistress of Charles II.,
the less said the better; and yet she was not entirely
void of good impulses, for it is well known that she
persuaded the king to establish and endow Chelsea
Hospital. But of Bracegirdle, the beautiful actress
who captivated all hearts, and whom Congreve was
thought nearly to worship, not a word reflecting upon
her moral character could be truthfully uttered. At
a London coffee-house one evening there chanced to
be gathered a score or more of her admirers, including
the Dukes of Devonshire and Dorset, besides other
members of the peerage. Bracegirdle's name had
been mentioned; when Lord Halifax said: "You all
of you praise the virtue of this lady; why not reward
her for not selling it? There are two hundred guineas
<i>pour encourager les autres</i>." A thousand guineas
were raised on the spot, which the noblemen took to
Bracegirdle, going into her presence in a body. As
it was a testimony intended in honor of her virtue,
she accepted it. No doubt a large portion of this
handsome tribute found its way very quickly into the
hands of her needy pensioners; for she was no more
estimable in her profession than noble in her charities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
The best dramatists wrote for her; and two of them,
Rowe and Congreve, when they gave her a lover in a
play seemed palpably to plead their own passions and
to make their individual court to her in fictitious
characters.</p>

<p>Having spoken of Nell Gwynn and Bracegirdle,
another English actress, Margaret Woffington, comes
forcibly to mind; and though we do not propose to
treat especially the profession of the drama, the incidental
mention of some of its members in this gossip
is not out of place. Her father was an Irish bricklayer
in Dublin, where Peg Woffington, as she was
best known, was a great public favorite long before
she came to London to find an equally agreeable
home. Her versatility of genius may be judged of
from the fact of her personating Lady Macbeth and
Sir Harry Wildare with equal excellence. The latter
character was a favorite one with Garrick, but he
gave up the part altogether after witnessing her excellence
in its assumption.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> She also was distinguished
for her benevolence and open-handed charity.
The manager of Covent Garden Theatre could always
be sure of a full house when he announced her in the
character of the gay, dissipated, good-humored rake,
Sir Harry Wildare. Margaret built and endowed two
almshouses at Teddington, Middlesex, and lies buried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>in the principal church of the district. In the height
of her popularity she declared that she preferred the
society of men to that of women; the latter, she said,
"talk of nothing but silks and scandal." Her end
was singularly dramatic. She was playing the character
of Rosalind with more than usual éclat, when she
was struck with paralysis, and died soon after in the
prime of life.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>We have spoken of accident as often determining
the development and directing the course of genius.
Edward Shuter was one of the most popular comedians
on the London stage in 1776, but he began life
as a pot-boy at a public-house in the neighborhood
of Covent Garden. A gentleman came to the house
one evening, and after refreshing himself he sent the
boy Shuter to call him a hackney-coach. On reaching
home he found that he had dropped his pocket-book;
and suspecting that he had lost it in the coach, he
went the next morning to the tavern to make inquiry.
He asked Shuter if he knew the number of the hack.
The poor boy could not read or write, and was totally
unskilled in numerals; but he knew the signs by which
his master scored the quarts and pints of porter
that were drunk, and to the gentleman's inquiry as
to the number of the coach which the boy had called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>for him Shuter said it was "two pots and a pint"
(771). This was unintelligible to the gentleman, but
was explained by the landlord. The coachman was
summoned, and the pocket-book recovered. This
acuteness of the boy interested the gentleman, and he
became his patron, sent him to school, and gave him
a start in the line of his choice, which was the theatrical
profession. Such is the story in brief of one of
the famous London comedians.</p>

<p>How many of our readers remember the one recorded
scene when Queen Elizabeth condescended to
coquet with Shakespeare? The great bard was performing
the part of a king; Elizabeth's box was contiguous
to the stage, and she purposely dropped her
handkerchief from the box upon the boards, at the
very feet of Shakespeare, having a mind thus to try
whether her poet would stoop from his high estate of
assumed majesty. "Take up <i>our</i> sister's handkerchief,"
was his prompt and dignified order to one of
the actors in his train.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>It will doubtless be found interesting to see recorded
in juxtaposition the words and the manner of death
of some of the great geniuses whom history mentions.
When Alonzo Cano, the famous Spanish artist, was
dying, the attendant priest presented before him an
ivory crucifix; Cano turned away and refused to look
at it because the sculpture was so bad, calling for a
plain cross, which he embraced, and died. Chaucer
breathed his last while composing a ballad. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the priest came whom Alfieri had been prevailed
upon to see, he requested him to call the next day.
"Death, I trust, will tarry four-and-twenty hours,"
he said, but died in the interim. Petrarch was found
dead in his library, leaning on a book. "I could wish
this tragic scene were over," said Quin the actor,
"but I hope to go through it with becoming dignity."
Pitt, the great statesman, died alone, in a solitary
house on Wimbledon Common. Rousseau, when dying,
asked to be carried to the window of the apartment
overlooking his garden, that he might look his
last on Nature.</p>

<p>When Malherbe the lyric poet was dying, he reprimanded
his nurse for making use of a solecism in her
language, and bade the priest stop his trite, cant talk
about heaven, saying, "Your wretched style only
makes me out of conceit with it." Bide, the English
monk and author, on the night of his death continued
to dictate to his amanuensis. He asked his scribe
how many chapters yet remained to complete the
work, and was told there was one. "Take your pen,"
he commanded, and went on with the work. By
and by the scribe said, "It is finished," just as his
master breathed his last. Roscommon, when expiring,
quoted from his own translation of the "Dies
Iræ." "All my possessions for a moment of time!"
were the dying words of Queen Elizabeth. The last
words of Cardinal Beaufort were, "What! is there
no bribing death?" The last words uttered by Byron
were, "I must sleep now." In his last moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Crébillon, who had composed two acts of his tragedy
of "Catiline," regretted that he had not been spared
to complete it.</p>

<p>Colorden on the day of his death was visited by his
friend Barthe, who requested his opinion of the comedy
of the "Selfish Man," which he came to read at his
bedside. "You may add an excellent trait to the
character of your principal personage," said Colorden.
"Say that he obliged an old friend, on the eve of his
death, to hear him read a five-act comedy!" "Let
me die to the sound of delicious music," were the
last words of Mirabeau. Herder died writing an ode
to the Deity, his pen on the last line. Heller died
feeling his own pulse; and when he found it almost
gone, turning his eyes to his brother physician, said,
"My friend, the artery ceases to beat!" "Tell Collingwood
to bring the fleet to anchor," said Nelson,
and expired. The last words of Charles I. were
uttered on the scaffold,&mdash;"I fear not death! Death
is not terrible to me!"</p>

<p>Curran's ruling passion was strong in death. Near
the close of his earthly hours his physician at his
morning call said he "seemed to cough with more
difficulty." "That's surprising," said the almost exhausted
invalid, "as I have been practising all night."
"There is not a drop of blood on my hands," said the
expiring Frederick V. of Denmark. "Let not poor
Nellie starve" (Nell Gwynn, his mistress), were
the last words of Charles II. "I have loved righteousness
and hated iniquity, therefore do I die in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
exile," said Pope Gregory VII. with his expiring
breath. Anne Boleyn turned to the executioner on
the scaffold, and pointing to her neck, said pathetically,
"It is small, very small indeed!" The last
words of Maria Theresa were, "I do not sleep; I wish
to meet my death awake." Madam Roland exclaimed,
"O liberty! liberty! how many crimes are committed
in thy name!"</p>

<p>It was in perfect accord with his character when
Chancellor Thurlow said at the closing moment of
his life, "I'm shot if I don't believe I'm dying!"
"World without end, Amen!" said Bunyan as he
breathed his last. "Guilty, but recommended to the
mercy of the court," whispered Lord Hermand. "For
the last time I commit soul, body, and spirit into His
hands," said John Knox in dying. "Trust in God,"
said President Edwards, "and you need not fear."
These were his last words. "If I had strength
enough to hold a pen," said Willian Hunter, the distinguished
anatomist, "I would write how easy and
delightful it is to die." The dying words of Louis
XIV. were, "I thought that dying had been more
difficult." Arthur Murphy the dramatist quoted in
his last breath Pope's lines,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Taught by reason, half by mere decay,<br />
To welcome death and calmly pass away."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>When asked if he heard the prayers which were
offered in his presence, the Duke of Marlborough replied,
"Yes, and I join in them." He never spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
again. "O Lord, open the King of England's eyes,"
said the martyr Tyndale as he died at the stake.
When those noble English reformers, Latimer and
Ridley, were being burned at the stake, "Be of good
cheer, brother," cried Ridley, "for our God will either
assuage the fury of this flame or enable us to abide
it." Latimer replied: "Be of good comfort, brother,
for we shall this day light such a candle in England
as by God's grace shall never be put out." Lady
Jane Grey's last words upon the scaffold were:
"Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit."
"Many things are growing plain and clear to me,"
whispered Schiller, and died with these words on
his lips.</p>

<p>Anna Lætitia Barbauld, the English authoress, wrote
with great poetic feeling and moral beauty. Her
husband became a lunatic, and she suffered much.
It was her beautiful self-sacrifice that gave the best
charm to her character. She wrote, among many
other works, a popular life of the novelist Richardson,
and some political pamphlets of great force and
excellence. Her series of books for children would
alone have given her lasting reputation. There occurs
to us in these closing pages the stanza which
she wrote in her old age, probably in her eighty-second
year, not long before her death,&mdash;lines which
Rogers and Wordsworth so much and so justly admired.
The former says in his "Table Talk" that
while sitting with Madame D'Arblay a few weeks
before her death, he asked her if she remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
these lines of Mrs. Barbauld's. "Remember them!"
answered the famous authoress, "I repeat them to
myself every night before I go to sleep."</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Life! we've been long together</span><br />
Through pleasant and through cloudy weather;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'T is hard to part when friends are dear;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perhaps 't will cost a sigh, a tear;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then steal away, give little warning,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Choose thine own time;</span><br />
Say not 'Good-night,' but in some brighter clime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bid me 'Good morning.'"</span><br /></p>

<p class="large center p4">CHAPTER XI.</p>


<p>Genius has its hours of sunshine as well as of
shadow, and when it finds expression in wit and
humor it is undoubtedly most popular. The Emperor
Titus thought he had lost a day if he had passed it
without laughing. Coleridge tells us men of humor
are in some degree men of genius; wits are rarely
so, although a man of genius may, among other gifts,
possess wit. As in pathos and tenderness "one touch
of nature makes the whole world kin," so is it in true
wit and humor with the appreciative. Obtuseness
will be unsympathetic under any circumstances. "It
is not in the power of every one to taste humor," says
Sterne, "however much he may wish it; it is the gift
of God! and a true feeler always brings half the entertainment
with him." Bruyere has somewhere said
very finely that "wit is the god of moments, but genius
is the god of ages." Some men of genius have found
their most natural exponent to be the pen; others
indulge in practical humor. Sheridan<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> belonged to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>this latter class; he was full of fun and frolic, ever
on the alert for an opportunity to exercise his humor.
When on a certain occasion he had been driving
about the town for three or four hours in a hackney-coach,
he chanced to see his friend Richardson, whom
he hailed, and invited into the vehicle. When they
were seated together he at once introduced a subject
upon which he and Richardson always differed, and
a controversy naturally ensued. At last, affecting
to be mortified at Richardson's argument, Sheridan
said abruptly, "You are really too bad; I cannot
bear to listen to such things: I will not stay in the
coach with you." And accordingly he opened the
door and sprang out, Richardson hallooing triumphantly,
"Ah, you're beat, you're beat!" Nor
was it until the heat of the victory had a little cooled
that he realized he was left in the lurch to pay for
Sheridan's three hours' coaching.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>Sheridan, profligate and unprincipled as he was,
still was capable of fine expression of sentiment and
true poetic fire. In a poem called "Clio's Protest;
or, the Picture Varnished," we find the following
really beautiful lines:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
"Marked you her cheek of rosy hue?<br />
Marked you her eye of sparkling blue?<br />
That eye in liquid circles moving;<br />
That cheek abashed at man's approving;<br />
The one Love's arrows darting round;<br />
The other blushing at the wound:<br />
Did she not speak, did she not move,<br />
Now Pallas, now the Queen of Love?"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The poets have frequently made satire an auxiliary
of their wit; and when the proportions are properly
adhered to, a favorable result is produced. Satire,
like many subtle poisons used as a medicine, may
be safely taken in small quantities, while an overdose
is liable to be fatal. In Chaucer's<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Canterbury
Pilgrims he draws his portraits to the life.
While he exposes the weakness of human nature, he
does not do so in surliness; a pleasant smile wreathes
his lips all the while. There is slyness, but no bitterness
in his satire. He would not chastise, he would
only reform his fellow-men. As illustrating exactly
the opposite spirit, we may instance Pope, Dryden,
and Byron, who, descending from their high estate,
often prostituted their genius to attacks upon personal
enemies or rivals, with keenest weapons, while
their opponents had no means of defence. The
"Dunciad" is a monument of satiric wit, or genius
belittled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>
<p>Swift, who wrote "cords" of worthless rhymes,
squibs, songs, and verses, which live as much by their
vulgar smartness as for the slight portion of true wit
which tinctures them, says: "Satire is a sort of glass
wherein beholders generally discover everybody's face
but their own; which is the chief reason for that kind
of reception it meets with in the world, and that so
few are offended with it." Hawthorne gave the Dean
a merited thrust when he said, "the person or thing
on which his satire fell shrivelled up as if the Devil
had spit on it." The <i>double entendre</i> to be found in
nearly all of Swift's effusions, epigrams, and verses,
comes with ill grace from a dignitary of the Church.
He was always ready with an epigram on all occasions.
One "lives in our memory" which he addressed
to Mrs. Houghton of Bormount, who took
occasion one day to praise her husband in Swift's
presence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"You always are making a god of your spouse;<br />
But this neither reason nor conscience allows:<br />
Perhaps you will say 'tis in gratitude due,<br />
And you adore him because he adores you.<br />
Your argument's weak, and so you will find;<br />
For you, by this rule, must adore all mankind."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The wit and humor of Shakespeare endear him to
our hearts; and what a rich harvest does the gleaner
obtain from his pages! Take "Love's Labor's Lost,"
for instance, a play produced in his youth, so full of
quips and quiddity as to live in the memory by whole
scenes. There is no lack of scathing sarcasm in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
play, but it leaves no bitter taste in the mouth, like
the "doses" of Swift or the more unscrupulous productions
of Pope in the same line. Ben Jonson,<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
who ranked so high as a dramatist, has been pronounced
to be, next to Shakespeare, the greatest wit
and humorist of his time. His expression was through
the pen, not by the tongue: no man was more taciturn
in society. Much of Jonson's matter was better
adapted to his time than to ours; words which seem
to us so coarse and vulgar passed unchallenged in
the period which gave them birth.</p>

<p>Here are five lines from Jonson, with which he
closes a play directed against plagiarists and libellers
generally. He sums up thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Blush, folly, blush! here's none that fears<br />
The wagging of an ass's ears,<br />
Although a wolfish case he wears.<br />
Detraction is but baseness' varlet,<br />
And apes are apes, though clothed in scarlet."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is said that Jonson was a "sombre" man. We
have seen that it is by no means always sunshine
with those who brighten others' spirits by their pen.
The great luminary is not always above the horizon.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>
<p>A friend remarked to the wife of one of our wittiest
poets, "What an atmosphere of mirth you must live
in, to share a home with one who writes always so
sportively and wittily!" The answer was a most significant
shake of the head.</p>

<p>We spoke of Dryden as a satirist; perhaps no
writer ever went further in the line of bitterness and
personality. His portrait of the Duke of Buckingham
will occur to the reader in this connection:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"A man so various that he seemed to be<br />
Not one, but all mankind's epitome;<br />
Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong,<br />
Was everything by starts, and nothing long;<br />
But, in the course of one revolving moon,<br />
Was chymist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>When a boy at school in Westminster, Dryden
more than once showed the budding promise of the
genius that was in him. When put with other classmates
to write a composition on the miracle of the
conversion of water into wine, he remained idle and
truant, as usual, up to the last moment, when he had
only time to produce one line in Latin and two in
English; but they were of such excellence as to presage
his future greatness as a poet, and elicit hearty
praise from his tutor. They were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Videt et erubit lympha pudica Deum!</i><br />
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
"The modest water, awed by power divine,<br />
Beheld its God, and blushed itself to wine."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Dryden's complete works form the largest amount
of poetical composition from the pen of one writer, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
the English language; and yet he published scarcely
anything until he was nearly thirty years of age.
From that period he was actively engaged in authorship
for forty years, and gave us some of the finest
touches of his genius in his second spring of life.
Addison wrote of Dryden at this period the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"But see where artful Dryden next appears,<br />
Grown old in rhyme, but charming e'en in years;<br />
Great Dryden next, whose tuneful Muse affords<br />
The sweetest numbers and the fittest words.<br />
Whether in comic sounds or tragic airs<br />
She forms her voice, she moves our smiles or tears;<br />
If satire or heroic strains she writes,<br />
Her hero pleases and her satire bites;<br />
From her no harsh, unartful numbers fall,<br />
She wears all dresses, and she charms in all."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard Porson, the profound scholar, linguist, and
wit, reared many monuments of classic learning, which
have however crumbled away, leaving his name familiar
to us only as a writer of <i>jeux d'esprit</i>; but these
are admirable. He was full of the sunshine of wit;
and though sarcastic and personal, as the nature of
his <i>bon-mots</i> compelled, he had no bitterness in his
reflections, and uttered them with a good-natured
laugh. Wonderful stories are told of his powers of
memory. He could repeat several consecutive pages
of a book after reading them once. It was he who
wrote a hundred epigrams in one night on the subject
of Pitt's drinking habit, one of which occurs
to us:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"When Billy found he scarce could stand,<br />
'Help, help!' he cried, and stretched his hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To faithful Harry calling.</span><br />
Quoth he, 'My friend, I'm sorry for't,<br />
'Tis not my practice to support<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A minister that's falling.'"</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The "faithful Harry" was Dundas, Viscount Melville.</p>

<p>The reply of Pitt to Walpole, March 6, 1741, is
one of the finest, most polished, and biting retorts
on record: "The atrocious crime of being a young
man, which the honorable gentleman has, with such
spirit and decency, charged upon me, I shall neither
attempt to palliate nor deny, but content myself with
wishing that I may be one of those whose follies may
cease with their youth, and not of that number who
are ignorant in spite of experience."</p>

<p>Dr. Gilles, the historian of Greece, and Dr. Porson
used often to meet and discuss matters of mutual interest
relating to the classics. These interviews were
certain to lead to very earnest arguments; Porson
was much the better scholar of the two. Dr. Gilles
was one day speaking to him of the Greek tragedies
and of the Odes of Pindar. "We know nothing," said
Gilles, emphatically, "of the Greek metres." Porson
answered: "If, Doctor, you will put your observation
in the singular number, I believe it will be quite
correct." In repartee he was remarkable. "Dr.
Porson," said a gentleman with whom he had been
disputing,&mdash;"Dr. Porson, my opinion of you is most
contemptible." "Sir," responded the Doctor promptly,
"I never knew an opinion of yours that was not con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>temptible."
Porson was a natural wit, so to speak.
Being once at a dinner-party where the conversation
turned upon Captain Cook and his celebrated voyages,
an ignorant person in order to contribute something
towards the conversation asked, "Pray, was
Cook killed on his first voyage?" "I believe he
was," answered Porson, "though he did not mind it
much, but immediately entered upon a second."</p>

<p>The sharpest repartee is both witty and satirical.
James II., when Duke of York, made a visit to Milton,
prompted by curiosity. In the course of his conversation
the Duke said to the poet that he thought his
blindness was a judgment of Heaven on him because
he had written against Charles I., the Duke's father;
whereupon the immortal poet replied: "If your Highness
thinks that misfortunes are indexes of the wrath
of Heaven, what must you think of your father's tragical
end? I have lost my eyes&mdash;he lost his head."</p>

<p>Few men equalled Coleridge in the matter of prompt
readiness of retort, and few have so misused the lavish
gifts of Providence.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> On a certain occasion he was
riding along a Durham turnpike road, in his awkward
fashion,&mdash;for he was no horseman,&mdash;when a wag,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>noticing his peculiarity, approached him. Quite mistaking
his man, he thought the rider a good subject
for a little sport, and so accosted him: "I say, young
man, did you meet a <i>tailor</i> on the road?" "Yes,"
replied Coleridge, "I did, and he told me if I went
a little further I should meet a <i>goose</i>!" The assailant
was struck dumb, while the traveller jogged
leisurely on.</p>

<p>Lord Bolingbroke, the ardent friend of Pope, was
often bitterly satirical, and notably quick at retort.
Being at Aix-la-Chapelle during the treaty of peace
at that place, he was asked impertinently by a Frenchman
whether he came there in any public character.
"No, sir," replied Bolingbroke, very deliberately; "I
come like a French minister, with no character at all."
Bolingbroke's talents were more brilliant than solid,
but the style of his literary work is admirable. It
is generally believed that he wrote the "Essay on
Man" in prose, and that Pope put it into verse, with
such additions as would naturally occur in such an
adaptation.</p>

<p>Painters, like poets, are equal at times to producing
the keenest epigrams. Salvator Rosa's opinion
of Michael Angelo's "Last Judgment" is an
instance of this. The brother artist wrote not
unkindly as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"My Michael Angelo, I do not jest;<br />
Thy pencil a great judgment has expressed;<br />
But in that judgment thou, alas! hast shown<br />
But very little judgment of thine own!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>We have already spoken of Molière<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> in these pages,
though only too briefly when his just fame is considered.
England has her Shakespeare, Spain her
Cervantes, Germany her Goethe, and France her
Molière. We have seen how triumphantly his powerful
genius made its way amid adverse circumstances,
until it enabled him, as Disraeli says, "to give his
country a Plautus in farce, a Terence in composition,
and a Menander in his moral truths." In short,
Molière showed that the most successful reformer of
the manners and morals of the people is a great
comic poet. Did not Cervantes "laugh Spain's chivalry
away"? It is a curious fact, worthy of note,
that Molière, who was so great a comic writer, and
such an admirable comedian upon the stage, should
have been socially one of the most serious of men
and of a melancholic temperament. It was a considerable
time before his genius struck out in the right
direction and became self-reliant. At the beginning
of his dramatic authorship he "borrowed bravely"
from the Italian, as Shakespeare did; and Spanish
legends were also adapted by his facile pen to dramatic
purposes, himself enacting chosen comedy parts
of his own plays.</p>

<p>This course, however, did not satisfy the genius of
Molière; he felt that he was capable of greater origi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>nality
and of more truly artistic work. After much
communing with himself he sought a new and more
legitimate field of inspiration and employed fresher
material. Having now the entrée to the Hôtel de
Rambouillet, he began to study with critical eye
the court life about him, soon producing his "Précieuses
Ridicules," which was a biting satire upon
the follies of the day, though delicately screened.
The author skilfully parried in the prologue any
application to his court associates, by averring that
the satire was aimed at their imitators in the provinces.
The <i>ruse</i> was sufficient, and the play was
performed without offence; but its significance was
nevertheless realized, and had its reformative influence
without producing too great a shock. It was
almost his first grand and original effort, and from
thenceforth his career was a triumphal march. He
is said to have exclaimed, "I need no longer study
Plautus and Terence, nor poach on the fragments of
Menander, I have only to study the world about me."
Subsequently the brilliant success of his "Tartuffe,"
his "Misanthrope," and his "Bourgeois Gentilhomme"
confirmed him in his conviction. Although society
felt itself arraigned, it was also humbled and powerless.
The author had become too great a power to
be suppressed.</p>

<p>Molière's domestic life, like that of only too many
men of genius, and especially of authors, was a wreck.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>
<p>It may be doubted if such persons ought to marry at
all. Rousseau is another instance of domestic infelicity;
and so are Milton, Dryden, Addison, Steele;
indeed, the list could be indefinitely extended. A
young painter of great promise once told Sir Joshua
Reynolds that he had taken a wife. "Married!" responded
the great master; "then you are ruined as
an artist." Michael Angelo's answer when he was
asked why he never married will be remembered:
"I have espoused my art, and that occasions me sufficient
domestic cares; my works shall be my children."
The marriage of men of genius forms a theme of no
little interest in the history of literature. It is herein
that genius has oftenest found its sunshine or its
shadow. Even Emerson has said, "Is not marriage
an open question, when it is alleged from the beginning
of the world that such as are in the institution
wish to get out, and such as are out wish to get in?"
Rousseau married a kitchen-girl, and Raphael allied
himself for the last eleven years of his life with a
common girl of Rome, whom he first saw washing
her feet in the Tiber. Judging from her portrait,
which he painted, and which still hangs in the Barberini
Gallery, she was by no means beautiful, though
the ensemble of head, face, and neck strikes the eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>as forming a very attractive whole. Margarita belonged
to the lower classes of the Eternal City, and
when Raphael died she went back to her former
obscurity. There must have been many noble qualities
in this young Roman girl, to have held the consistent
devotion of so great an artist for an entire
decade. She must have possessed some inspiring
influence over him other than forming his mere physical
model. Sympathetic she undoubtedly was, or else
no such union could have lasted; and one feels that
he must have imparted to her a portion of the glowing
aspirations which fired his own genius.</p>

<p>Goethe married to legitimize his offspring; Niebuhr,
to please a mistress; Churchill, because he was dispirited
and lonely; Napoleon, to obtain influence;
Wilkes, to oblige a friend; Lamartine, in gratitude
for a fortune which was offered to him, and which he
rapidly squandered; Wycherly married his servant to
spite his relations. And so we might fill pages with
brief mention of the influences which have led men
of note to assume matrimonial relations. Balzac's
marriage forms a curious example. He met by chance,
when travelling, a youthful married lady, who told
him, without knowing who he was, how much she
admired Balzac's writings. "I never travel without
a volume of his," she added, producing a copy.
Greatly flattered, the author made himself known to
the lady, who was a princess by birth, and who became
his constant correspondent until the death of her husband,
when she gave him her hand and fortune. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
were married, and settled to domestic life in a château
on the Rhine.</p>

<p>But we have wandered away from Molière before
quite concluding the consideration of himself and his
works. One of his most popular productions, "L'Impromptu
de Versailles," has often been borrowed from;
indeed, the general idea has been appropriated bodily
both on the English and American stage. In this piece
Molière appears in his own person and in the midst
of his whole theatrical company, apparently taken
quite aback because there is no suitable piece prepared
for the occasion. The characters are the actors
as though congregated in the Green Room, with whom
the manager is consulting, now reprimanding and
now advising. In the course of his remarks he throws
out hints of plots designed for plays, criticises his own
productions, gives amusing sketches of character, and
in short presents a humorous, realistic, and unique
scene which formed as a whole a very complete
comedy, and which proved a grand success. Louis
XIV. was his friend and patron; being himself particularly
fond of theatrical performances, he often made
shrewd suggestions, which the actor and dramatist
took good care faithfully to adopt. Indeed, it was said
that this then unique idea of the Green Room brought
before the curtain was from his Majesty's own brain,
though greatly improved upon by Molière. Some of
the plots hinted at by the manager before his company
in this play were afterwards amplified and perfected
so as to become popular dramas, not only by Molière,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
but by other dramatists. This is notably the case
with Beaumarchais' "Barber of Seville," which is but
the elaboration of one of these incipient plots. However,
Molière was himself so liberal a borrower, like
Montesquieu, Racine, and Corneille, he could well
afford to lend to others. Bruyère embodies whole
passages from Publius Syrus in his printed works;
and La Fontaine borrowed his style and much of his
matter from Mazot and Rabelais. Though we have
referred to this subject before, we will add that Voltaire
looked upon everything as imitation; saying that
the instruction which we gather from books is like
fire: we fetch it from our neighbor's, kindle it at
home, and communicate it to others, till it becomes
the property of all.</p>

<p class="large center p4">CHAPTER XII.</p>


<p>Every thoughtful person must often have realized
how close is the natural sympathy between artists in
literature and artists of the pencil and brush; between
painters and poets. Belori informs us of a curious
volume in manuscript by the hand of Rubens, which
contained among other topics descriptions of the passions
and actions of men, drawn from the poets and
delineated by the artist's own graphic pencil. Here
were represented battles, shipwrecks, landscapes, and
various casualties of life, copied and illustrated from
Virgil and other classic poets, showing clearly whence
Rubens often got his inspiration and ideas of detail.
The painter and the poet are the Siamese-twins of
genius. The finest picture ever produced is but
poetry realized, though each art has its distinct province.
The same may be said as to sculpture and
poetry. It has long been a mooted question whether
the Laocoön in sculpture preceded or was borrowed
from the idea expressed in poetry. Lessing believed
that the sculptor borrowed from the poet. All the
sister arts<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>&mdash;music, sculpture, poetry, and painting&mdash;are
most intimately allied. When great composers,
like Mozart, were contemplating a grand expression
of their genius, they endeavored to inspire themselves
with lofty ideas by reading the poets; while masters in
literature and oratory have sought for a similar purpose
the elevating and soothing influence of music.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>
<p>Orators have not infrequently depended upon more
material stimulus, as we have seen in the instances
of Pitt and Sheridan. The biographer of More tells
us that when Sir Thomas was sent by Henry VIII. on
an embassy to the Emperor of Germany, before he delivered
his important remarks he ordered one of his
servants to fill him a goblet of wine, which he drank
off at once, and in a few moments repeated it, still
demanding another. This his faithful servant, knowing
his master's temperate habits, feared to furnish,
and even at first declined to do so, lest he should
expose him thereby before the Emperor. Still, upon
a reiterated order, he brought the wine, which was
rapidly swallowed by Sir Thomas, who then made his
address to the sovereign in Latin, like one inspired,
and to the intense admiration of all the auditors,
the Emperor himself complimenting him upon his
eloquence. More was a strange medley of character.
Devout in his religious convictions, he was yet as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>light-hearted as a child,&mdash;at times wise as Solomon
in his discourse, and anon descending almost to
buffoonery; a truly good man at heart, and yet often
espousing the worst of causes. Though a pronounced
reformer, he predicted that the Reformation would
result in universal vice. He is represented to have
had a supreme contempt for money and a true generosity
of spirit. With the most solemn convictions
of the realities of death, he yet died upon the scaffold
with a joke upon his lips.</p>

<p>That imaginative English artist Barry, the great
historical painter, advised his pupils as follows: "Go
home from the Academy, light your lamps, and exercise
yourselves in the creative part of your art, with Homer,
with Livy, and all the great characters ancient and
modern, for your companions and counsellors." Barry
has left behind him works upon art which should not be
read except with care, unbiassed judgment, and honest
appreciation. His own eccentricities, all arising from
a passion for art, led his contemporaries to criticise the
man and ignore his work. He was wildly enthusiastic
in all things relating to art, but yet sometimes exhibited
the coarseness of his early associations. He
was born at Cork, from whence his father sailed as a
foremast hand aboard a coasting vessel, and designed
his son for the same humble occupation; but the lad
had other and higher aspirations, until finally he attracted
the notice of people able to advise and help
him. Humbly born and self-educated as he was, he
presented some of the highest aspects of genius. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the generosity of Edmund Burke he was sent to Rome,
where he studied art for three or four years under
favorable circumstances. On his return to England
he took high rank, and was engaged by the Academy
as a professor. At times in his lectures before the
students he would burst into such vehement enthusiasm
as to electrify his listeners, and they in turn
would rise to their feet and shout applauses long and
deep, entirely heedless of the great turmoil which they
created. Then Barry would exclaim: "Go it, go it,
boys; they did so at Athens!"</p>

<p>Literature and art should be wedded together. The
careful reader and the keen observer gather up a
mental harvest and store it for use. What many
conceive to be genius is often but reproduction.
Hosts of ideas have passed through the crucible of
the author's mind and have been refined by the process,
coming forth individualized by the stamp of his
personality. He is none the less an originator, a
creator; originality is after all but condensed and
refined observation.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of nonsense written and credited
by the world at large as to the inspiration of
authorship. Some of the very best poetic turns of
thought are the children of purest accident. Sir
Joshua Reynolds, calling upon Goldsmith one day,
opened his door without knocking, and found him engaged
in the double occupation of authorship and
teaching a pet dog to sit upon his haunches, now casting
a glance at his writing-table, and now shaking his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
finger at the dog to make him retain his upright position.
The last lines upon the paper were still wet,&mdash;as
Sir Joshua<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> said when he afterwards told the story,&mdash;and
formed a part of the description of Italy:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"By sports like these are all their cares beguiled:<br />
The sports of children satisfy the child."<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Goldsmith, with his usual good humor, joined in the
laugh caused by his whimsical employment, and acknowledged
to the great painter that his boyish sport
with the dog suggested the lines.</p>

<p>Goldsmith was always the wayward and erratic
being whom we have represented in these pages. His
habit on retiring at night was to read in bed until
overcome by somnolence; and he was so little inclined
to sleep, that his candle was kept burning until the
last moment. His mode of extinguishing it finally,
when it was out of immediate reach, was characteristic
of his indolence and carelessness: he threw his
slipper at it, which consequently was found in the
morning covered with grease beside the overturned
candlestick.</p>

<p>If, as we have attempted to show, authors exhibit
oftentimes a spirit of vanity, it must be admitted that
readers as frequently exhibit evidence of captiousness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>
<p>Those who sit down to peruse a book without a good
and wholesome appetite for reading are very much
in the same condition as one who approaches a table
loaded with food, without a sense of hunger. In
neither case can one be a proper judge of what is before
him; mental or physical pabulum requires for just
appreciation a wholesome appetite. Unjust criticism
often grows out of an attempt to force the appetite,
the censor coming to his task in a wrong humor.
The author is usually severely judged; he is solus, his
critics are many: if he satisfies one class of readers
he is sure to dissatisfy another. Swift's definition of
criticism, in his "Tale of a Tub," is pertinent. "A
true critic," he says, "in the perusal of a book, is like
a dog at a feast, whose thoughts and stomach are
wholly set upon what the guests fling away, and consequently
is apt to snarl most when there are the
fewest bones."</p>

<p>Edgar A. Poe's sarcasm upon the "North American
Review," in the matter of criticism, will long be remembered.
It was generally considered at the time
not only a keen but a just retort. Our erratic genius
writes: "I cannot say that I ever fairly comprehended
the force of the term 'insult,' until I was given to
understand, one day, by a member of the 'North
American Review' clique, that this journal was not
only willing but anxious to render me that justice
which had been already accorded me by the 'Revue
Française,' and the 'Revue des Deux Mondes,' but
was restrained from doing so by my 'invincible spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
of antagonism.' I wish the 'North American Review'
to express no opinion of me whatever,&mdash;for I have
none of it. In the mean time, as I see no motto on
its titlepage, let me recommend it one from 'Sterne's
Letter from France.' Here it is: 'As we rode
along the valley, we saw a herd of asses on the top
of one of the mountains: how they viewed and <i>reviewed</i>
us!'" No one can deny that Poe possessed
remarkable genius; but his best friends could not
approve either his temper or his habits.</p>

<p>Balzac complained of lack of appreciation; though,
as has just been shown, he captivated one of his
readers to such a degree as to bring him a wife and
a fortune. "A period," he says, "shall have cost us
the labor of a day; we shall have distilled into an
essay the essence of our mind; it may be a finished
piece of art, and they think they are indulgent when
they pronounce it to contain some pretty things, and
that the style is not bad!" Montaigne said that he
found his readers too learned or too ignorant, and
that he could please only a middle class who possessed
just knowledge enough to understand him.
To read well and to a consistent purpose is as much
of an art as to write well. It was said of Dr. Johnson
by Mrs. Knowles that "he knows how to read
better than any other one; he gets at the substance
of a book directly; he tears out the heart of it."</p>

<p>A literary friend of the writer has long adopted an
effective aid to memory in connection with reading.
After perusing a book he writes down the date, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
place, and under what circumstances it was read, and
in a few concise lines gives the impression it has left
upon his mind. This he does not design as a criticism;
it is intended for himself only. At a future
day he can take up the volume, since perusing which
he may have read a hundred in a similar manner,
and by turning to his brief comment at the close,
the power of association enables him to recall the
subject of the volume and virtually to remember the
contents. He assures us that the circumstances under
which he became familiar with the book, if fairly remembered,
recall even its detail. For our own part,
we have trusted solely to a retentive memory, and
the choice of such lines of reading as inclination has
suggested. The books which we consult lovingly will
long remain with us, requiring very little effort to
impress their contents upon the brain.</p>

<p>How suggestive is this theme of books and the
reading of them! Whipple eulogizes them thus appropriately:
"Books,&mdash;light-houses erected in the great
sea of time; books,&mdash;the precious depositories of the
thoughts and creations of genius; books,&mdash;by whose
sorcery time past becomes time present, and the whole
pageantry of the world's history moves in solemn
procession before our eyes. These were to visit the
fireside of the humble, and lavish the treasures of
the intellect upon the poor. Could we have Plato
and Shakespeare and Milton in our dwellings, in the
full vigor of their imaginations, in the full freshness
of their hearts, few scholars would be affluent enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to afford them physical support; but the living images
of their minds are within the reach of all. From
their pages their mighty souls look out upon us in
all their grandeur and beauty, undimmed by the
faults and follies of earthly existence, consecrated
by time."</p>

<p>Poets have been more addicted to building castles
upon paper than residences upon the more substantial
earth. Though the old axiom of "genius and
a garret" has passed away, both as a saying and in
the experiences of real life, still it had its pertinency
in the early days of literature and art. Ariosto, who
was addicted to castle-building with the pen, was
asked why he was so modestly lodged when he prepared
a permanent home for himself. He replied
that palaces are easier built with words than with
stones. But the poet, nevertheless, had a snug and
pretty abode at Ferrara, Italy, a few leagues from
Bologna, which is still extant. Leigh Hunt says:
"Poets love nests from which they can take their
flights, not worlds of wood and stone to strut in."
The younger Pliny was more of a substantial architect,
whose villa, devoted to literary leisure, was magnificent,
surrounded by gardens and parks. Tycho
Brahe, the great Danish astronomer, built a grand
castle and observatory combined on an island of the
Baltic, opposite Copenhagen, which he named the
"Castle of the Heavens."</p>

<p>Many of our readers have doubtless visited the
house which Shakespeare built for himself in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
native town on Red-Lion Street. In passing through
its plain apartments one receives with infinite faith
the stereotyped revelations of the local cicerone.
Buffon was content to locate himself for his literary
work and study in an old half-deserted tower, and
Gibbon, as we have seen, to write his great work in
the summer-house of a Lausanne garden. Chaucer
lived and wrote in a grand palace, because he was
connected with royalty; but he never dilated upon
such surroundings,&mdash;his fancy ran to outdoor nature,
to the flowers and the trees. Milton<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> sought an
humble "garden house" to live in; that is, a small
house in the environs of the city, with a pleasant
little garden attached. Addison wrote his "Campaign"
"up two pair of back stairs in the Hay-market."
Johnson tells us that much of his literary
work was produced from a garret in Exeter Street.
Paul Jovius,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> the Italian author, who wrote three
hundred concise eulogies of statesmen, warriors, and
literary men of the fourteenth century, built himself
an elegant château on the Lake of Como, beside the
ruins of the villa of Pliny, and declared that when
he sat down to write he was inspired by the associations
of the place. In his garden he raised a marble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>statue to Nature, and his halls contained others of
Apollo and the Muses.</p>

<p>The traveller visits with eager interest Rubens'
house in his native city of Antwerp, a veritable
museum within, but plain and unpretentious without.
Rubens is to the Belgian capital what Thorwaldsen
is to Copenhagen. Spenser lived in an Irish castle
(Kilcolman Castle), which was burned over his head by
a mob; and, sad to say, his child was burned with it.
In his verses Spenser was always depicting "lowly
cots," and it was on that plane that his taste rested.
Moore's vine-clad cottage at Sloperton is familiar to
all. In the environs of Florence we still see the cottage
home where Landor lived and wrote, and in the
city itself the house of Michael Angelo,&mdash;plain and
unadorned externally, but with a few of the great
artist's household gods duly preserved in the several
apartments. The historic home of the poet Longfellow,
in Cambridge, has become a Mecca to lovers
of poetry and genius; while Tennyson's embowered
cottage at the Isle of Wight is equally attractive to
travellers from afar.</p>

<p>Pope<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> had a modest nest at Twickenham, and
Wordsworth at Rydal Mount, the beauties of both being
more dependent upon the surrounding scenery than
upon any architectural attraction. Pope declared all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>gardens to be landscape-paintings, and he loved them.
Scott made himself a palatial home at Abbotsford,
which was quite an exception to that of his brother
poets. Dr. Holmes's unpretentious town house in
the Trimountain city overlooks the broad Charles,
and affords him a glorious view of the setting sun.
Emerson's Concord home was and is the picture of
rural simplicity. Hawthorne's biographer makes us
familiar with his red cottage at Lenox. Bryant made
himself an embowered summer cottage at Roslyn,
New York State. Lowell has a fine but plain residence
overlooking the beautiful grounds of Mount
Auburn. Nothing could be more simple and lovely
than Whittier's Danvers home. None of these poets
have built castles of stone, whatever they may have
done under poetical license.</p>

<p>"I never had any other desire so strong, and so like
to covetousness," says the poet Cowley, "as that I
might be master at least of a small house and a large
garden, with very moderate conveniences joined to
them, and there dedicate the remainder of my life
only to the culture of them and study of Nature, and
then, with no desire beyond my wall,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">'&mdash;&mdash;Whole and entire to lie,</span><br />
In no unactive ease, and no unglorious poverty.'"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Cowley at last got what he so ardently desired, but it
was not until he was too old and broken in health to
find that active enjoyment which he had so fondly anticipated.
He died in the forty-ninth year of his age.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>We spoke of the contrast which was manifest between
the private and public life of Molière. These
paradoxes are strange, but by no means uncommon in
the character of men of genius. It will be remembered
that Grimaldi, the cleverest and most mirth-provoking
clown of his day in England, was often under medical
treatment on account of his serious attacks of melancholy.
It seems almost incredible that men of such
profound judgment in most matters, as were Dr.
Johnson and Addison, should have been so inexcusably
weak as to entertain a belief in ghosts,&mdash;an
eccentricity which neither of them denied. Byron,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
who as a rule was noted for his shrewd common-sense,
was so superstitious that he would not help a
person at table to salt, nor permit himself to be served
with it by another's hand. There were other equally
absurd "omens" which he strenuously regarded.
Cowper, who was a devoutly religious man, deliberately
attempted to hang himself,&mdash;an act entirely at
variance with his serious convictions. So also Hugh
Miller, one of the most wholesome writers upon the
true principles of life, wrested his own life from
his Maker's hands.</p>

<p>Pope, who was such a bravado with his pen, boldly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>denouncing an army of scholars and wits in his
"Dunciad," was personally an arrant coward, who
could not summon sufficient self-possession to make a
statement before a dozen of his personal friends. The
paradox which existed between Goldsmith's pen and
tongue passed into an axiom: with the one he was all
eloquence and grace; with the other, as foolish as a
parrot. Douglas Jerrold, whose forte was as clearly
that of wit and humor as it is the sun's province
to shine, was ever wishing to write a profound essay
on natural philosophy. Newton, highest authority in
algebra, could not make the proper change for a
guinea without assistance, and while he was master
of the Mint was hourly put to shame by the superior
practical arithmetic of the humblest clerks under him.
Another peculiarity of Newton was that he fancied
himself a poet; but who ever saw a verse of his composition?
Judged by all accepted rules, Charles
Lamb experienced ills sufficient to have driven him
to commit suicide; whereas the truth shows that
with "his sly, shy, elusive, ethereal humor" he was
ordinarily the most genial and contented of beings.</p>

<p>Curious beyond expression are the many-sided
phases of genius, and indeed of all humanity. Let us
therefore have a care how we judge our fellow-men,
since what they truly are within themselves we cannot
know, and may only infer by what they seem to
be relatively to ourselves. Undoubtedly the germs
of virtue and of vice are born within the soul of
every human being; their development is contingent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
upon how slight a cause! Nor in our readiness to
censure should we forget in whose image we are all
created,&mdash;"a little lower than the angels, a little
higher than the brutes." It is the nature of man, like
the harp, to give forth beautiful or discordant sounds
according to the delicacy and skill with which it is
touched. We find what we come to find,&mdash;what, indeed,
we bring with us. Richard Baxter, the prolific
author upon theology, at the close of a long life said:
"I now see more good and more evil in all men than
heretofore I did. I see that good men are not so good
as I once thought they were; and I find that few are
so bad as either malicious enemies or censorious professors
do imagine."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Goldsmith makes his Chinese philosopher recount the name
of Homer as the first poet and beggar among the ancients,&mdash;a
blind man whose mouth was more frequently filled with verses
than with bread.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Shakespeare's line expired in his daughter's only daughter.
Several of the descendants of Shakespeare's sister Joan, bearing a
strong family likeness to the great poet, were, so late as 1852,
living in and about Stratford, chiefly in a state of indigence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> I have no doubt whatever that Homer is a mere concrete
name for the rhapsodies of the Iliad. Of course there was a
Homer, and twenty besides. I will engage to compile twelve
books, with characters just as distinct and consistent as those of
the Iliad, from the metrical ballads and other chronicles of England,
about Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.&mdash;<i>Coleridge.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> They must needs be men of lofty stature, whose shadows
lengthen out to remote posterity.&mdash;<i>Hazlitt.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The Edinburgh "Review," once the most formidable of critical
journals, took its motto from Publius Syrus:&mdash;
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"Judex damnatur cum nocens absolvetur."<br />
</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The kindly human sympathy exhibited by Terence contributed
largely to the popularity of his dramas. Whenever the
often-quoted words, "I am a man; and I have an interest in
everything that concerns humanity," were spoken upon the
Roman stage, they were received with tumultuous applause by
all classes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Crassus, a Roman triumvir, noted for his great wealth, who
lived about a hundred years before the Christian Era, bought
and sold slaves. These he educated, and taught the highest accomplishments
of the day, sparing no labor or expense for the
purpose. These educated slaves were then sold for large sums
of money, so that any rich man could own his private poet and
scholar. We are told by Plutarch that some of these slaves brought
enormous prices into the treasury of Crassus.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> "What can they see in the longest kingly line in Europe,"
asks Sir Walter Scott, "save that it runs back to a successful
soldier?"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> When approached by Madame de Tencin, who was finally
eager to acknowledge so distinguished a son, he replied:&mdash;
</p><blockquote><p>
"Je ne connais qu'une mère, c'est la vitrière."<br />
</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> I knew a very wise man that believed if a man were permitted
to make all the ballads, he need not care who should make
the laws of a nation.&mdash;<i>Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Rachel made her debut at the Théâtre Français of Paris,
in 1838. She came to this country in 1855, and performed in
our Eastern cities. Three years later she died of consumption,
near Cannes, in the South of France.  When she was giving
one of her readings before the Duke of Wellington, she
perceived that all her audience were ignorant of the French
language except the Duke himself.  She went on, however,
at her best, consoling herself that he at least understood her.
After it was over, the Duke approached the great actress, and
said: "Mademoiselle, our guests have had a great advantage over
me; they have had the happiness of hearing you: I am as deaf as
a post."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Hazlitt, after remarking that Shakespeare's play of "All's
Well that Ends Well" is taken from Boccaccio, adds: "The
poet has dramatized the original novel with great skill and comic
spirit, and has preserved all the beauty of character and sentiment
without improving upon it, which is impossible."  In the town
of Certaldo, Tuscany, the house in which Boccaccio was born is
shown to curious travellers. On the façade is an inscription
speaking of the small house and a name which filled the world.
"Before seven years of age," says Boccaccio, "when as yet I
had met with no stories, was without a master, and hardly knew
my letters, I had a natural talent for fiction, and produced some
small tales."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The author has stood upon the Bridge of Pinos, at Granada,
from whence Columbus, discouraged and nearly heart-broken, was
recalled by Isabella, after having been denied and dismissed, as
he supposed, for the last time. The messenger of the relenting
queen overtook the great pilot at the bridge, and conducted him
back to the Hall of the Ambassadors, in the Alhambra.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Disraeli tells us that the French ambassador to Spain, meeting
Cervantes, congratulated him on the great success and reputation
gained by his "Don Quixote;" whereupon the author whispered in
his ear: "Had it not been for the Inquisition, I should have made
my book much more entertaining." When Cervantes was a captive,
and in prison at Algiers, he concerted a plan to free himself
and his comrades. One of them traitorously betrayed the plot.
They were all conveyed before the Dey of Algiers, who promised
them their lives if they would betray the contriver of the plot.
"I was that person," replied Cervantes; "save my companions,
and let me perish." The Dey, struck with his noble confession,
spared his life and permitted them all to be ransomed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> "The Testimony of the Rocks," a noble and monumental
work, by Hugh Miller, was published in 1857. The night following
its completion its author shot himself through the heart. The
overworked brain had given out, and all was chaos. He had sense
enough left to write a few loving lines to his wife and children,
and to say farewell.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Falling into a state of morbid despondency and mental derangement,
Tannahill committed suicide, by drowning, in his
thirty-sixth year. James Hogg, the "Ettrick Shepherd," visited
him a short time before his death. "Farewell," said Tannahill,
as he grasped his brother poet's hand; "we shall never meet
again!"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> One of Bunyan's biographers tells us his library consisted of
two books,&mdash;the Bible and Fox's "Book of Martyrs." The latter
work, in three volumes, is preserved in the Bedford town library,
and contains Bunyan's name at the foot of the titlepages written
by himself. Bunyan's crime, for which he was imprisoned
twelve years, was teaching plain country people the knowledge
of the Scriptures and the practice of virtue.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Is it generally known that among the accomplishments of his
after years was that of music and an instrumental performer?
Leigh Hunt says that "Dr. Franklin offered to teach my mother
the guitar, but she was too bashful to become his pupil. She
regretted this afterwards, possibly from having missed so illustrious
a master. Her first child, who died, was named after him."
</p><p>
In his Autobiography Franklin says: "At ten years of age I
was called home to assist my father in his occupation, which was
that of a soap-boiler and tallow-chandler, a business to which he
had served no apprenticeship, but which he embraced on his arrival
in New England, because he found his own, that of a dyer,
in too little request. I was accordingly employed in cutting the
wicks, filling the moulds," etc.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> His original name was John Horne, but being adopted and
educated by William Tooke, he assumed his name. His humble
birth being suspected by the proud striplings at Eton, when he
was questioned as to his father he replied, "He was a Turkey
merchant!" He was imprisoned for a year because he said that
certain Americans were "murdered" by the king's troops at Lexington!</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Elliott, the Corn-Law Rhymer, was no pander to popular
cries unless they were founded on reason. Being asked,
"What is a communist?" he answered, "One who has yearnings
for equal division of unequal earnings. Idler or bungler,
he is willing to fork out his penny and pocket your shilling."
Whipple says: "His poetry could hardly be written by a man
who was not physically strong. You can hear the ring of his
anvil, and see the sparks fly off from his furnace, as you read
his verses."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> While these notes are writing, the city of Boston is erecting a
bronze statue to the memory of Garrison, which is to adorn one
of its finest and largest public parks,&mdash;a fitting tribute to the
honored philanthropist.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Hosea Biglow's words are specially applicable here:&mdash;
</p><blockquote><p>
"An' yit I love th' unhighschooled way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ol' farmers hed when I wuz younger;</span><br />
Their talk wuz meatier, an' 'ould stay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While book-froth seems to whet your hunger."</span><br />
</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> His "Death on the Pale Horse," now in the Academy of
Fine Arts at Philadelphia, is the most remarkable of his productions
in this country. The Pennsylvania Hospital, in the same
city, has also "Christ Healing the Sick," by West,&mdash;a truly
noble conception, a vigorous work of art, and a generous gift from
the author.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> His old employer, Moses Kimball, paid Ball twenty thousand
dollars for the bronze group now standing in Park Square.
It represents President Lincoln Freeing the Slaves. The purchaser
presented it to the city of Boston.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Hans Christian Andersen was one of the most gifted of
modern authors. In his story entitled "Only a Fiddler," he has
given many striking pictures from the experience of his own life.
His best books are his fairy-tales, of which he has published
several volumes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Any one who could place the tragedy of "Cleone" before that
of "Venice Preserved," by Otway, in point of merit, must have
been singularly prejudiced.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Thackeray says: "He was lazy, kindly, uncommonly idle;
rather slovenly, forever eating and saying good things. A little
French abbé of a man, sleek, soft-handed, and soft-hearted."
A Mr. Rich was the manager of the theatre in which Gay's
"Beggar's Opera" was brought out. Its unprecedented success
suggested the epigram that "it made Rich gay, and Gay
rich."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> Among his liberal bequests were four hundred thousand
dollars for the establishment of a public library in New York,
to which his son, William B. Astor, subsequently added as much
more. The Astor Library is therefore one of the best endowed
institutions of the kind in America.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Webster, when told that there was no room for new lawyers
in a profession already overcrowded, answered, with the proud
consciousness of genius and character, "There is always room at
the top."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Charles XII. put his whole soul into the cause of Sweden at
the time when she was threatened with extinction by her enemies.
He fought all Europe,&mdash;Danes, Russians, Poles, Germans,&mdash;and
gave away a kingdom before he was twenty. At his coronation at

statesmen from the nursery." These were: "Octavius Cæsar,
more successful in the arts of policy than even the great Julius,
never guilty of youthful indiscretion, or, we are sorry to say, of
youthful virtue; Maurice of Saxony, the preserver of the Reformed
religion in Germany, in that memorable contest in which
his youthful sagacity proved more than a match for the veteran
craft of Charles V.; and the second William of Orange, the preserver
of the liberties of Europe against the ambition of Louis
XIV., who, as a child, may be said to have prattled treaties and

one of his admirable pictures, some one present doubted
that it was his work, so remarkable was its excellence, and Barry
at the time had not established any special fame. The artist was
so affected by the remark that he burst into tears and retired.
Burke, who was present, followed him to pacify his grief. The
painter by chance quoted some passages of the newly published
essay on the "Sublime and Beautiful." It appeared anonymously,
and Burke took occasion to sneer at it, when Barry showed more
feeling than he had done about his picture. He commended the
essay in the most earnest language. Burke, smiling, acknowledged
its authorship. "I could not afford to buy it," replied the astonished
artist, "but I transcribed every line with my own hands;" at
the same time pulling the manuscript from his pocket. This was
commendation so sincere and appreciative, that the great author
and the great painter clasped hands in mutual friendship.</p></div>

for a cavalry regiment. Time and exposure are fast obliterating
the original work of Da Vinci. In 1520 Leonardo da Vinci
visited France at the urgent solicitation of Francis I. His health
was feeble, and the king often came to Fontainebleau to see him.
One day when the king entered, Leonardo rose up in bed to receive
him, but in the effort fainted. Francis hastened to support him;
but the eyes of the artist closed forever, and he lay encircled in
the arms of the monarch.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> Rogers says that Gibbon took very little exercise. He had
been staying some time with Lord Sheffield in the country; and
when he was about to go away, the servants could not find his
hat. "Bless me," said Gibbon, "I certainly left it in the hall on
my arrival here." He had not stirred out of the house during
the whole of the visit.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_92_92" id="Footnote_92_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> Châteaubriand was the most famous French author of the
First Empire. It will be remembered that he visited this country
in 1791. He wrote, relative to dining with Washington at Philadelphia:
"There is a virtue in the look of a great man. I felt
myself warmed and refreshed by it during the rest of my life."
His career was full of remarkable vicissitudes. He was once left
for dead on the battlefield, suffered banishment, and was for a
time imprisoned in the Bastile.</p></div>

genius, and also for his accomplishments in painting, poetry,
music, and song. In early childhood, it is said of him, "while

Waller, himself a poet, politician, and critic, said: "The old
blind schoolmaster, John Milton, has published a tedious poem
on the fall of man; if its length be not considered a merit, it has
no other." The second edition was not brought out until seven
years later, 1674, the year in which Milton died. This edition
was prefaced by two short poems, the first by Andrew Marvell in
English, and the second by Samuel Barrow in Latin, in which
Milton's poem is placed "above all Greek, above all Roman
fame."</p></div>

some promised verses for him, the disheartened poet replied:
"When I wrote verses I was young, had sufficient food, was a

his life from 1660 to 1672 was taken down in 1801. It stood on
what is now the vacant piece of land at the corner of the High
Street and Silver Street, used as a market-place, in Bedford. Silver
Street was so named because it was the quarter where the Jews in
early times trafficked in the precious metals.</p></div>

A duel with a brother actor, whom unhappily he killed, caused
him to be imprisoned by the sentence of the court. He was ten

on the town of St. Thomas, James I. basely resolved to carry into

sentence, and was beheaded the next morning.</p></div>

on the banks of the river Manzanares, reading a book, and
from time to time breaking off to roar with laughter and show
other signs of delight. "That person is either mad or is reading
'Don Quixote,'" said the king,&mdash;a volume of panegyric in a few

as to his incomparable history of the famous Knight La Mancha;
it sprung at once into unbounded popularity, while "it laughed

He said on one occasion, "If once a man indulges himself in
murder, very soon he comes to think little of robbing; and from
robbing he comes next to drinking and Sabbath-breaking, and
from that to incivility and procrastination. Once being upon this
downward path, you never know where you are to stop. Many a

he thought little of at the time."</p></div>

and received with great favor by the people; but the bold, patriotic,

wife said of him that he was a better dancer than musician.
Leigh Hunt tells us that when Mozart became a great musician, a
man in distress accosted him in the street, and as the composer
had no money to give him, he bade him wait a little, while he
went into a coffee-house, where he wrote a beautiful minuet extempore,
and, sending the poor man to the nearest music-dealer's, made
him a present of the handsome sum gladly paid by the publisher.</p></div>

reckless sarcasm which prompted his answer to the Prince of Verona,

how "he delighted to rove through the meanders of enchantment,

in London, in the course of his advertised list of objects to
be disposed of, held up two small half sheets of paper, all written
over, torn, and mutilated. He called these scraps most interesting,
but apologized for their condition. There was present a
highly intelligent company of amateurs in autographs, attracted by
the sale. The first offer for these scraps of paper was ten pounds.
The bids rose rapidly until sixty-five was reached, when they were
knocked off; but as there proved to be two bidders at that price,
it was necessary to put them up again. They were finally closed
at one hundred pounds. These scraps of paper, which were
almost a hundred years old to a day, were the original copy of
"Gray's Elegy."</p></div>

lecturer, says: "She was a shrieking, howling, red-faced, passionate,
self-indulgent person; now spoiling him by ridiculous indulgence,
now subjecting him to her extravagant wrath. A ridiculous
person, an absurd person, short and fat. What a sight it was to
see her in a rage, running round the room after the lame boy, and
he mocking, and dodging, and hopping about! Although that
may be droll to hear, it was tragical to suffer from; and there is
much mercy to be bestowed upon a man whose father was a blackguard
and whose mother was a fool!"</p></div>

friend: "Charles is very busy at the office; he will be kept there
to-day until seven or eight o'clock. He came home very smoky
and drinky last night, so that I am afraid a hard day's work will
not agree very well with him. I have been eating a mutton-chop
all alone, and I have just been looking into the pint porter-pot,
which I find quite empty, and yet I am still very dry; if you
were with me, we would have a glass of brandy and water, but it
is quite impossible to drink brandy and water by one's self." Is
not this a quiet peep behind the curtain?</p></div>

of nature Lamb never cared for music. But this was the case
with Dr. Johnson, Fox, Pitt, and Sir James Mackintosh. Johnson
was observed by a friend to be extremely inattentive at a
concert, while a celebrated solo player was running up the divisions
and subdivisions of notes upon the violin. The friend desiring to
induce the Doctor to give his attention, remarked how difficult the
performance was. "Difficult, do you call it, sir?" replied Johnson.
"I wish it were impossible." It will also be remembered
that Goethe was not particularly fond of music. Once at a court
concert in Weimar, when a pianist was in the middle of a very
long sonata, the poet suddenly rose up, and, to the horror of the
assembled ladies and gentlemen, exclaimed, "If this lasts three
minutes longer, I shall confess everything!"</p></div>

and vanished like vapor before the sun."</p></div>

"and of good humor, too, and wholesome thought," adds Lowell.
He was scholar, courtier, soldier, ambassador, one who had known
poverty as a housemate, and who had been the companion of
princes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_193_193" id="Footnote_193_193"></a><a href="#FNanchor_193_193"><span class="label">[193]</span></a> Jonson died on the 6th of August, 1637, at the age of sixty-three.
He survived both wife and children. He was buried in
Westminster Abbey. A common slab laid over his grave bears
the inscription, "O Rare Ben Jo<i>h</i>nson!"&mdash;not Jonson, as it is
always printed. Jonson was a heavy drinker, and it has been said
that every line of his poetry cost him a cup of sack. Canary was
his favorite drink; of which he partook so immoderately that his
friends called him familiarly the Canary Bird.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_194_194" id="Footnote_194_194"></a><a href="#FNanchor_194_194"><span class="label">[194]</span></a> Coleridge says sadly in his "Literary Life," "I have laid too
many eggs in the hot sands of this wilderness the world, with
ostrich carelessness and ostrich oblivion. The greater part, indeed,
have been trodden under foot and are forgotten. But yet
no small number have crept forth into life, some to furnish
feathers for the caps of others, and still more to plume the shafts
in the quiver of my enemies,&mdash;of them that, unprovoked, have
lain in wait against my soul."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_195_195" id="Footnote_195_195"></a><a href="#FNanchor_195_195"><span class="label">[195]</span></a> So disgusted was the paternal upholsterer, Pocquelin, at his
son's choice of the stage for a profession, that he virtually disowned
him. Molière was an assumed name, to save the family
honor; but how rapidly that name became famous.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_196_196" id="Footnote_196_196"></a><a href="#FNanchor_196_196"><span class="label">[196]</span></a> Molière was fascinated by his young wife; her lighter follies
charmed him. He was a husband who was always a lover. The
actor on the stage was the very man he personated. Mademoiselle
Molière, as she was called by the public, was the Lucile in
"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme." With what a fervor the poet feels
her neglect! with what eagerness he defends her from the animadversions
of the friend who would have dissolved the spell!&mdash;<i>Disraeli.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_197_197" id="Footnote_197_197"></a><a href="#FNanchor_197_197"><span class="label">[197]</span></a> Campbell the poet and Turner the artist were dining together
on a certain occasion with a large party. The poet was called
upon for a toast, and by way of a joke on the great professor of
the "sister art" gave, "The Painters and Glaziers." After the
laughter had subsided, the artist was of course summoned to propose
a toast also. He rose, and with admirable tact and ready
wit responded to the author of "Pleasures of Memory" by giving
"The Paper-stainers."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_198_198" id="Footnote_198_198"></a><a href="#FNanchor_198_198"><span class="label">[198]</span></a> Sir Joshua Reynolds was inclined to tell stories about Goldsmith's
negligence in his habits, his want of neatness in dress, his
unkempt appearance at all times, and his absolute want of cleanliness.
No doubt the reflection was merited by the careless author;
but the famous artist was himself such a gross consumer of snuff
that his shirt-bosom, collars, and vest were never in a respectable
condition.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_199_199" id="Footnote_199_199"></a><a href="#FNanchor_199_199"><span class="label">[199]</span></a> Milton was a London boy in his eighth year when Shakespeare
died (1616); he was seventeen years old when Fletcher died
(in 1625); and twenty-nine when Ben Jonson died (in 1637).</p></div>

altogether in Latin. Clement VII. made him a bishop, and he
enjoyed the favor of Charles V. and Francis I., which enabled
him to amass great wealth. He died at Florence in 1552.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_201_201" id="Footnote_201_201"></a><a href="#FNanchor_201_201"><span class="label">[201]</span></a> "Pope died in 1744," says Lowell, "at the height of his
renown, the acknowledged monarch of letters, as supreme as
Voltaire when the excitement and exposure of his coronation-ceremonies
at Paris hastened his end, a generation later."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_202_202" id="Footnote_202_202"></a><a href="#FNanchor_202_202"><span class="label">[202]</span></a> No other man presented within himself such a bundle of contradictions.
"He seems an embodied antithesis," says Whipple,&mdash;"a
mass of contradictions, a collection of opposite frailties and
powers. Such was the versatility of his mind and morals, that
it is hardly possible to discern the connection between the giddy
goodness and the brilliant wickedness which he delighted to exhibit."
In all his relations he was consistently inconsistent.</p></div>
